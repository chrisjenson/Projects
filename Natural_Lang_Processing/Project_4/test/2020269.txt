Totally worthless . . .	Much more frightening than the actual movies themselves is the fact that one continues to discover slasher movies that were released in the 1980's ! This decade truly is an inexhaustible source for low-budgeted and inane horror pictures that often ended up in oblivion shortly after coming out . " Deadly Games " is such a prototype example of the ? righteously ? forgotten 80's slasher ! The plot and characters are derivative , the killings are unimaginative and the attempts to insert humor are downright pitiable . Tension apparently was an unavailable option as well . The plot drags slowly and spends way too much time focusing on bimbos and losers cheating on each other . Past halfway in the film I still hadn't figured out which characters are sleeping together whilst they aren't supposed to , and who the hell cares about that anyway ? The strange murder of a voluptuous town girl ( sadly , the hottest chick dies first ) reunites a group of old friends and makes them speculate together about what could have happened . One of them is a copper ? though not a very convincing one ? investigating the case , one girl is the wannabe cynical sister of the first victim and all the rest are dispensable dorks . There are plenty of bone-headed who are waiting , no ? BEGGING to get slaughtered but nothing happens . At a certain point , the ultimate low point of the film , you're actually watching at how three of the characters ( one of them being the copper ) sit in a theater and see a film ? for several long minutes ! What's the freaking point ? ! ? And why can't that chick stop talking to herself or at least realize her jokes and one-liners are totally not funny ? If the theater scene wasn't painfully dire enough yet , they carry on playing a board game and football whilst the most abysmal 80's song can be heard . How is this relevant ? And you , you stupid cop , shouldn't you be looking for the killer ? In case you haven't noticed yet , " Deadly Games " is one of the worst and most redundant slashers of the entire 80's , and that's saying something , since we mentioned the inexhaustible offer before . It doesn't even deserve to be called a slasher , as the slashing is next to none ! This is a pile of steaming rubbish about a bunch of losers struggling with midlife crises whilst still in their early thirties . Avoid like the plague .
More garbage from Uwe Boll ( ocks ) !	Nearly every director active in the field of horror is aware of it by now , except for Uwe Boll ! Turning popular violent video games into movies is a bad idea and it's guaranteed to result in an unwatchable film . Wasn't the humiliation after that dreadful " House of the Dead " enough evidence for him ? Obviously not , because here's " Alone of the Dark " and he already finished his new potential turkey " Bloodrayne " . I don't really feel like wasting too many words on this idiotic film , so I'll just second the majority of opinions around here : " Alone in the Dark " is a lousy and very irritating film that truly deserves his ranking among the hundred worst movies ever made . The plot ( for as far as you can use the term " plot " ) isn't just rubbish , it's also highly unoriginal and déjà-vu ! Ancient alternate civilizations . . . . gateways to evil dimensions . . . secret government agencies that cover up atrocities . . . kidnapping orphans to experiment upon . . . It all sounds like a very bad episode from " the X-files " . The CGI effects are pathetic and the visuals and sound effects are only able to give you a stomach ache . There's absolutely no humor in this film and it's really sad to witness how all the actors take their roles so serious . Talking about acting , this turkey has some of the worst ever ! Especially Stephen Dorff should urgently consider a major career change as he only appeared in very mediocre movies lately . Christian Slater looks ludicrous in his role of butt-kicking hero and you can't possibly expect us to see Tara Reid as an intelligent archaeologist , can you ? The most alarming fact to me was that I saw this film at a festival were Uwe Boll personally came to present his film . He was talking about this project as he was a new prodigy and the savior of future horror ! Painful . . . very painful .
A simple " O " or " A " at the end makes quite the difference . . .	The Italians are undeniable masters in the questionable " art " of ripping off and imitating movies . What they do is take an innovative , money-making and foreign concept , maintain the basic plot and just add a whole lot of action , sleaze and political incorrectness . But what to do when the non-Italian original is already a reputedly notorious film and quite difficult to surpass in terms of slop and controversy ? Well then , I guess , you simply disregard everything in terms of story-building or stylishness and fully focus on making something that is practically a porno movie ! This Italian turkey was inspired by Richard Fleischer's successful slavery-saga " Mandingo " , released one year earlier , but since the makers were even too lazy to think up a different title , you shouldn't expect anything that even remotely resembles a narrative depth , character drawings , unsettling atmosphere or thought-provoking statements regarding cross cultural relationships . " MandingA " is pure and simply a sexploitation effort where the plot only develops itself throughout the last ten minutes , in other words when you stopped caring a long time ago already . The characters in this film are a gathering of despicable bastards , which is of course to expect when you're dealing with wealthy and obnoxious white folks running a plantation in South America . The elderly and supremely sleazy owner of the place is a widower ( who probably also won a couple of " Moustache-of-the-Year " awards ) who exploits and extendedly whips the slaves working for him . His mistress , who if I understood correctly is also his cousin ( ? ) , is a genuine bitch of a woman who enjoys provoking arguments and sneaks out of the house overnight to copulate with crucified slaves . When the plantation owner's son returns from Europe , after approximately 25 minutes of purely wasted running time , the plot slightly begin to develop itself at last . The handsome young man has sex with the bitchy woman a couple of times ( even in front of the slaves , supposedly to " demonstrate " how their masters do it ? ) but eventually he falls in love with the cherubic preacher's daughter . His romantic preference obviously makes the bitchy woman mad with anger , and she plots a horribly cruel act of vengeance that will alter life on the plantation forever . Hey ? I just realized this brief description of the plot actually makes " Mandinga " sound like an interesting film ! Well , it's NOT and I apologize if I raised anyone's anticipations . It's an incredibly boring and hideous film to struggle through , but if the themes appeal to you , then definitely check out the aforementioned " Mandingo " . Much rather than sick exploitation , that film is a truly insightful portrait of one of mankind darkest history pages and it was also a properly produced film , with real actors , great music and impressive filming locations . " Mandinga " has nothing , absolutely nothing to offer .
Destroying zombies and chewing tobacco !	God-awful zombie movie that very well might be the WORST Italian horror production ever , and that's saying a lot with all those numberless " Dawn of the Dead " rip-offs and Lucio Fulci wannabes . This movie is incompetent in every possible aspect . It's so bad that it even comes close to ruining the memory of all the good movies it's inspired on ! The story : a factory , strategically located in the middle of the New Guinean jungle , suffers from a complete meltdown and the poisonous gas that escapes causes the native tribes to transform into walking flesh-eating corpses . Two journalists team up with a S . W . A . T team that is sent to the jungle and together they have to kill a whole lot of zombies before they can reach the factory . Naturally , this zombie romp is extremely gory , with brutal massacres and other types of pure filth every 5 seconds . But the make-up effects are pitiful and evoke more chuckles than feelings of disgust . Inspired by the almighty " Cannibal Holocaust " , director Bruno Mattei ( who's my pick for Italy's worst horror director ) stuffs his film with images and footage of real jungle wildlife , only here it's very misplaced and completely pointless . In all honesty , there is ONE good scene involving a child-zombie that effectively illustrates the infection and the impact of the virus on human beings . The acting is terrible and the script contains a countless amount of stupidities like , for example , a detailed course of how to properly chew tobacco . Avoid , unless you're looking for a good laugh and don't mind wasting 100 minutes of your precious life with it .
Be VERY afraid of " The Dark "	Yes , be afraid ? Not so much because the plot is disturbing or the monster-effects are frightening ( au contraire ! ) , but actually because it's such an irredeemably bad film that there's a good chance you'll suffer from permanent brain damage ! This has got to be one of the most embarrassing horror productions of the late 70's ( and there are a lot to choose from ) , but what do you expect with a script that hastily got altered in the middle of shooting ? That's right , the monster we're dealing with here is a genuine zombie-alien ! Initially , it was just going to be a zombie , but since Ridley Scott's " Alien " broke a lot of box-office records in the meantime , the producers of " The Dark " thought it would be stupid NOT to cash in on that success ! What do you picture a zombie-alien to look like ? Apparently the writers weren't sure , neither , so eventually it's just an over-sized guy that constantly walks in the dark and occasionally shoots laser beams from his eyes . All by himself , without a spaceship or even some sort of earthly mission , the ' zombalien ' prowls the streets at night , ripping off people's heads and making the local police forces look like complete imbeciles ( which they are ) . William Devane stars as a lonely hippie-loser who does ? nothing , really . The largest part of the film is just plain boring ; the monster's attacks are shown on an entirely black screen with just some cheesy noises on the background , and Cardos ' directing is very muddled . He really isn't to blame , as he took over from Tobe Hooper and never had something that even remotely looks like a script to work with . " The Dark " incomprehensibly wasn't rewarded with a special Oscar for the astonishingly inept visual & make-up effects ! Those laser beam eyes , as well as the subsequent explosions are simply hilarious and pretty much define the term " cheesy " .
Jean Rollin is a weirdo !	There you have it ? another disillusion on my account ! I had really high hopes that " The Rose of Iron " would be Jean Rollin's absolute BEST film and finally something different than those stupid lesbian-vampire films he always makes . For some inexplicable reason , his movies like " Lips of Blood " or " Requiem for a Vampire " are hugely popular among avid cult-fans , but ? believe me ? there're absolutely no quality elements to find in them . " The Rose of Iron " seemed different ? The plot outline is very promising and the fact that it's so rarely known simply makes it more appealing . But only a couple of minutes into the film and you're already confronted to another load of nonsense and a giant amount of " what-the-hell " - moments . The universe in which Rollin's movies are set is just totally messed up ! Dig this : a beautiful girl falls head over heels in love with a bizarre guy after he reads a morbid poem to her during some party where none of the guests seem to know each other . The next day , the young couple agrees to bike riding near an abandoned and ominous looking train-station ? Okay , maybe a bit eccentric , but still acceptable . Then , they think it's a good idea to go to the local cemetery and make love inside a family-tomb ! ? ! Perhaps I don't know anything about romance or poetry but this is just downright wrong ! Anyway , night falls , they get locked in the cemetery and , shortly after , they both start to behave very strangely ? especially the girl . One thing I can't deny is that the setting looks staggering . The graveyard where 90 % of the movie takes place is probably the most macabre filming location in horror-history ever . The neglected ancient graves and overgrown nature look very eerie and disturbing and it's all very atmospherically photographed . Unfortunately , it's NOTHING but an empty package . The script is incredibly tedious with awful dialogues and absolutely no tension . The nudity and sleaze in Rollin's previous movies was exploitative and extremely pointless , but at least there was something to distract you ! " The Rose of Iron " is tame , very un-sexy and utterly disappointing . As hilarious as it may seem , to me Rollin's most endurable movie is the laughable " Zombie Lake " .
Back to Aladdin with you , dumb " genie " ?	" The Lamp " is incredibly stupid 80's smut that can be found in practically every video store in my country whereas other , much better horror gems from that same decade are nearly impossible to purchase anywhere ! Such a thing annoys the hell out of me ! All in all , there's ONE remotely good sequence in this film ( defenseless girl killed in bathtub by snakes ) , but the remaining 84 minutes are a textbook example of what horror shouldn't be like . Dumb characters run around , doing & saying the most ridiculous things while threatened by an " evil " Djinn that appears to be made out of plasticine . Juvenile delinquents steal the titular lamp from an old lady's house and get killed . The ancient relic then becomes property of a national museum in Texas for further examination and exhibition . Some kids , among them the curator's daughter , develop the bright idea of spending their Friday night in the museum's basement ( what can possibly be exciting about that ? ) and , naturally , they get killed by the djinn in various ways . End of story . The acting is horrible , possibly even among the WORST I've ever seen , and first-time director Tom Daley seems to leave out tension & atmosphere on purpose . The make up is even too cheesy to look charming and the romantic sub plots are intolerably tedious . One of the museum night guards sings opera songs during his shift until he gets speared . He's actually the most talented person involved in the whole production .
Overly silly and fright-free " horror-comedy "	Making a horror comedy that simultaneously is funny AND suspenseful is pretty much the hardest thing to accomplish in cinema . Only the truly great directors like , say , Sam Raimi ( " The Evil Dead " ) can pull this off , so don't expect a new guy in the business to succeed . Fortunately for writer / director / producer Tony Shyu , he isn't overly pretentious and does never at one point attempt to make his film look like a genuine horror production . He merely puts the emphasis on the comedy factors , and although not always equally successful , at least he manages to keep " Tequila Body Shots " endurable . The film starts off as a typical high-school comedy , in the style of " American Pie " , with stereotypical teenage characters that only have sex and booze on their minds , and it really takes a very long time before until the horror elements are mixed in . The plot centers on two groups of college friends ( three male film students and the nerd they can't get rid off + three random girls ) that mysteriously get invited to a Halloween party across Mexican borders . They encounter a spiritual doctor handing out all sorts of magic potions , party locations that vanish overnight and devilish voices in the background ; all leading to the inevitably derivative and dull horror finale of reincarnation & vengeance from beyond the tomb . One of the girls turns out to be the mirror image of a Mexican duchess slain by her jealous husband nearly 100 years ago and only one of the boys ? Johnny ? can prevent that her soul will be taken to hell for all eternity . The horror elements of the story definitely miss their effect and the references towards the Greek mythology ( the tale of Orpheus and the boat-ride to hell ) are utterly misplaced . They're lost on the target audience of this type of film , anyway . Luckily enough , a handful of jokes and comical situations are entertaining enough to keep you alert . Particularly Ted's character is good for a couple of laughs , as he sees himself as God's gift to women even though he's the most annoying Star Wars nerd imaginable . The girls form terrific eye candy , but only the abnormally yummy Stephanie Arellano takes her top off , so the sleaze-factor of " Tequila Body Shots " isn't exactly impressive , neither . There's no gore or spectacular action sequences and the climax is so exaggeratedly happy & joyful it nearly made me feel miserable . NOT recommended , not even to the handful of teenage fans Joey Lawrence has left since starring in " Blossum " . Yuck .
Stop the torture ! ! !	I was glad when the film was over ? and , correct me if I'm wrong , but that can't really be the point now , can it ? Christopher Lee is a true icon of horror cinema but his name equally is inevitably linked to a couple real stinkers , and this " Castle of Fu Manchu " is without a doubt the smelliest one ! The previous Fu Manchu installment ( also directed by Jess Franco ) already was a dire film but this one is even worse ! Franco makes the exact same mistakes here as in did in " The Blood of Fu Manchu " : far too many characters , too much wannabe-intelligent nonsense and an enormous lack of action . This time , the evil Chinese criminal attempts to realize his pretty retarded dream of world domination by turning ocean water into ice . He therefore kidnapped a brilliant scientist who developed a formula , but the poor guy suffers from a heart disease so Fu has to kidnap another scientist in order to perform the world's first heart-transplant ! Meanwhile , good old Nayland Smith starts to chase his nemesis , as well as a powerful community of Istanbul opium-addicts ! The screenplay is incredibly dumb and the film contains some of the cheesiest moments in history . Like the ludicrous intro in which Fu makes an enormous Caribbean cruise-ship sink to the bottom of the South Atlantic Ocean . If I didn't know any better , I would think that Franco rips off " Titanic " 30 years before it was made ! The acting is weak ( poor Christopher is very uninterested ) , there's no sleaze and not even a bit of humor . Jess Franco honored himself by playing an insignificant supporting role while he can't even handle the directing properly . This film is so bad that even the exhilarating-sounding titles are fake ! The Castle of Fu Manchu ? ? Technically , it's not even his castle ! And what about " The Torture Chamber of Fu Manchu " ? ? Did anyone see a torture device ? I sure didn't ? Avoid this one at all costs !
Abominable , indeed . . .	I feel they should have honored this movie which a much more appealing title ? Something like " The touching tale of a boy and his tumor " , for example ? or maybe even " The barf that ate my friends and family " ! Either way you look at it , this has got to be one of the sickest and most demented movies someone ever thought up ! Following the good old 80's splatter rules , " The Abomination " totally ignores atmosphere and substance , going straight for an immeasurable amount of gore . The opening sequence alone already contains more blood and guts than a hundred other horror films and easily offended people will immediately stop watching . This vicious intro is a compilation of the film ' grossest moments and for some incomprehensible reason it completely spoils the rest of the movie before it even properly begun . " The Abomination " introduces us to a family of white trash in the wastelands of America . An adolescent boy with a dead end job and a mother whose obsessed by a TV-guru . One day , mommy pukes out a tumor and it immediately takes possession of the boy . The constantly growing tumor forces the boy to kill people and serve their bodies as lunch ! Call me insane but I somewhat like basic idea ? It's more or less a very perverted update of the " Little Shop of Horrors " premise , directed by Roger Corman in 1960 . The budget is extremely low and the cast is a bunch of amateur hillbillies with nothing better to do . In case your horror-standards are low , this is perfect gory entertainment . We're talking axes , chainsaws , slit throats , severed limbs , pitchfork-killings and entire buckets of human guts ( literally ) . In the film's most redundant sequence , we witness how the infamous TV-guru takes a dump in his office toilet ? . Talking about tastelessness ! One piece of advice : this movie goes well with beer . Loads and loads of beer ? . and vomit bags .
The Hills have Eyesore	Sigh ? the stupid government once again attempted to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier , and of course the experiments went terribly wrong , burdening us with a half man-half mutant who pukes an awful lot and squeaks like a little girl whenever he's upset . Lance Henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project , but he returns ( bringing the whole family with him ) when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree . " Mind Ripper " certainly is a watchable horror movie , but it's very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame cliché you can think off ( including the estranged father / rebellious teenage son sub plot . . . yawn ) . The characters are like wooden puppets , the dumbest things are being said and done and there's a completely pointless dream-sequence . . . coming from the monster ! ! ! There's a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert-locations are effectively eerie . Lance Henriksen is adequate as always , even though this is yet another inferior production he stars , and Giovanni Ribisi surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in . For some reason , this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as " The Hills Have Eyes part 3 " . Is it because it handles about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert ? Is it because Wes Craven was once again involved , as a producer this time ? Or maybe it's because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky Michael Berryman in the 1977 original ? Who knows . . . Who cares ? Wes Craven probably financed this project because his son co-wrote the script and it's always moving to discover that your offspring is equally untalented as you are . Not recommended !
Big disappointment	The Bunker more or less was the first film that combined the real-life drama of WWII with supernatural aspects of horror . From that point of view , it should be respected for its originality . Maybe I've seen too many similar movies already that were released after The Bunker . I saw ' Deathwatch ' and ' Below ' and to be entirely honest , I'm pretty tired of seeing movies in which ' evil ' is portrayed as something that is constantly present ? . but you can not see it . The plot of this film involves a group of German soldiers ( although they're all speaking with deep British accents ) who're stuck in a Bunker near the German-Belgian border . Through visions and dwelling forces , they're faced with horrors from the past . The more their situation becomes critical ( American soldiers slowly surround their isolated location ) , the more the soldiers go insane . Director Green desperately tries to build up an unbearable tension and also the cast makes good efforts to bring madness and hopelessness to their character's faces . But it just isn't helping ? As a viewer , you never really care about their merciless fade ( maybe because they're German soldiers ? ? ? ) . Who knows , maybe cast and crew try a little TOO hard to focus on the supernatural elements , while they should have thought about adding more action and relentless war-cruelty instead . Whatever way you look at it , The Bunker is a missed opportunity and a dreadfully tedious manner to waste an hour and a half of your precious lifetime .
How do you say " boring " in Japanese ?	Hmmm . . . I really seem to be missing on something here . Practically all my fellow IMDb-users are full of praise for this sequel to Ringu , but I don't second these opinion . It really thought it was a dreadful movie and a very unpleasant cinema experience . How much I'd like to support the Japanese horror-business and encourage people to discover it , I just don't think this is a good representation for it . Personally , I think there's ONE big disease in the film industry : the " easy-money " concept ! Small and simple films become a huge and unexpected success and that encourages the producers to shoot a sequel as soon as possible , in order to make even more money . This disease seems to have contaminated Japan as well now , since I really think Ringu 2 suffers from it . Absolutely NOTHING happens in the first 30 minutes of this film ! ! Than we're served a full quarter of suspense , exciting cinema and good character development . After that , it's downhill again till the end-credits role . A real shame actually , because those short 15 minutes of highlights really proved that there still was a lot of potential to continue the original story of Ringu . The plot involves the mind and will of the little boy from Ringu - Yoichi - taken over by the evil little girl Sadako . To itself , not a bad starting point but poorly executed . You're most likely to read a lot of comments that state Ringu2 is scary and full of suspense . Well , I think some people confuse suspense with complexity . Ringu 2 is nowhere near scary and I think slow and everlasting are more appropriate words . If you're interested in seeing a really scary Japanese movie , I suggest you check out " Audition " by Takashi Miike or even " Dark Water " by the same director who directed this film . Ringu 2 can easily be skipped
Hornee . . . Is that really his name ?	Now , what exactly is this supposed to be ? Let's pose the same question in multiple-choice format , shall we ? Is " Trader Hornee " : A ? a comedy ? B ? a sex film ? C ? a jungle adventure ? D ? all of the above . Surely the creators will try and convince you it's a mixture of everything , but the painful truth is that " Trader Hornee " eventually ends up being nothing at all . I appreciated the spirit and joyfulness of everyone involved in the cast , but after barely 20 minutes or so , the film has little else to offer but sheer boredom and forced chuckles . Private eye Hornee ( his name is an obvious running joke ) and his playful assistant are hired by a bank director and sent to Africa to look for the heiress of a wealthy couple of adventurers that went missing 16 years ago . For you see , during their quest to capture a rare white gorilla , the girls ' parents were killed by a tribe of savages and she was never heard of again . Hornee , his assistant , some greedy relatives , a gossipy journalist and a scientist still on the lookout for the white gorilla form quite the unusual expedition crew and discover that the girl is still alive , but not exactly willing to return to the civilized world . The plot , and clearly also the title , is based on a 30's movie called " Trader Horn " that I haven't seen but heard very good things about . The concept of a ' White tribal queen ' also got used in several cheap and sleazy ( Italian ) cannibal flicks , but ? at least not to my knowledge ? never in a sexy comedy . Well , the genre classification is debatable , since the film isn't very funny or sexy . All the ladies ? especially the jungle queen ? look delicious and show a fair amount of flesh , but these moments are too brief and practically always second to lame jokes . For early 70's standards and , moreover , Something Weird traditions , " Trader Hornee " isn't nearly naughty or rancid enough and simply pales in comparison with " The Adult Version of Jekyll and Hyde " , " Space Thing " and " Sinderella " . The S & M loving cousins are cute and the scenes with the white gorilla actually stalking the team provoke some genuine laughs , but overall the film is a waste of time .
Got Ammo ?	The all-time favorite movie of director Bruno Mattei ? may he rest in peace ? undoubtedly must have been " Predator " . One of the last films Mattei made before his death was called " Cannibal Ferox 3 : Land of Death " and it was an extremely blatant imitation of " Predator " where he simply replaced the intergalactic hunter with a tribe of cannibals . When I watched that film , I didn't even know yet that " Robowar " existed and was thus unaware of the fact that Mattei already pulled off the exact same trick nearly twenty years earlier ! This is , again , a shameless and outright rip-off of the classic 80's action flick starring Arnold Schwarzenegger , yet this time replacing the alien with an out-of-control robot that was initially designed as a ? surprise , surprise ? hi tech secret warfare weapon . Every other even remotely memorable element of " Predator " gets copied here , like the testosterone-driven lead characters , rotting human cadavers lying all around the jungle , the blurry computerized view from inside the robot's helmet , entire pieces of dialogs and even the who-played-who end credits ! Needless to say this is a terribly inept and laughable B-movie exploitation product , but it is guaranteed entertainment to watch ; especially in case you're an avid fan of typically Italian trash . Bunch of beefcake mercenaries , all of them with bad-boy attitudes and carrying around heavy artillery to compensate for their lack of brain capacities , are sent into to the jungle to complete a mission they know absolutely nothing about . They end up facing a practically indestructible handmade killing machine , although it suspiciously looks like a guy in a latex suit talking like he's a defect cassette with songs for children on it . The Robo-Soldier wipes out everyone before the replacement Arnie leader ( Reb Brown ) discovers it was constructed using spare body parts from his buddy who died in the Vietnam War . End of story . Obviously " Robowar " is just an insignificant and utterly brainless popcorn Sci-Fi / action / War flick with nothing else than explosives and violent shootouts . Speaking of which , I guess Bruno Mattei spent most of the nearly non-existent budget on explosives and ammunition ! These dim-witted mercenaries literally fire off gazillions of bullets . Multiple sequences exist of one hireling randomly starting to shoot at trees and the others joyously join in and waste an entire arsenal . But hey , giving the quality of the acting performances , a serenade of bullets is actually less painful to listen to than the atrocious dialogs . The robot is hilariously cheesy , especially when he produces noise and recollects his past . I cannot possibly reward this movie with a rating that is any higher , but please rest assured it is recommended and guaranteed entertainment ! note : if you are , like me , a sucker for old movie posters and DVD illustrations , you might have noticed that the cover image depicted here on this page is not " Robowar " but for " Robo Man " , an even obscurer 70's Sci-Fi sleeper .
An entire alien-race of Marty Feldmans ? ! ?	" Killers from Space " is cheap and silly but mainly boring 60's Sci-Fi that incomprehensibly escaped the attention of the genius MST3K-team . The film starts somewhat promising and there's an amusement peek near the middle , but overall it's pretty useless and forgettable . The only reason why some people still occasionally mention it is because of the most hilarious portrayal of extra-terrestrial life in the history of science fiction . The aliens ? or " killers " , as suggested in the title ? are ordinary humans , only they have exaggeratedly giant eyes that point in all possible directions . In fact , the aliens all strangely resemblance Marty Feldman ( ) , only they're meant to look like menacing monsters instead of legendary comedians . The rest of the plot is pretty unimportant , as you'll only have " eyes " for the alien monsters . But anyway : whilst doing nuclear testings in the Nevada desert , an eminent researcher disappears , only to show up again a couple of days later with a bad case of amnesia . Bit by bit , he remembers that he was temporarily abducted by weird aliens ( their eyes constantly developing because of the ever-growing darkness ) and they even carefully explained him why it's essential for them to eliminate humanity and take over our planet ! Of course , no one believes Dr . Douglas at first and he's even considered a fugitive criminal for a while , but he ends up saving the world ! Yay ! ! Pretty stupid movie , with almost no special effects and loads of wooden acting performances by an unknown cast . Luckily enough it's short and it also contains several " so bad it's good " moments . ( ) I absolutely don't mean any disrespect towards Marty Feldman . He was a great comedian and I totally loved his work .
Alice Doesn't Trip Here Anymore	The recent revival of Grindhouse-cinema ( courtesy of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez ) thankfully brought some lost and presumed missing horror and exploitation gems of the late 60's and 70's back in to the spotlights , but inevitably it also helped bringing some awful and righteously forgotten stinkers to the surface . Some brand new DVD-label in my country ? clearly inspired by the success and oddity value of Something Weird Video ? even released this " Alice in Acidland " on disc and promoted it as a true highlight of the rancid exploitation era . Well , it isn't really . This is a terrible film , rapidly shot and edited together to further cash in on the huge success of other ( and better ) contemporary drug-movies like " The Trip " and " Head " and basically the LSD-version of the classic anti-propaganda joke " Reefer Madness " . That particular ' documentary ' ? whether government funded or not ? taught us that Marihuana is responsible for potentially intelligent teenagers to commit adultery , cause hit-and-run accidents , play with guns and even kill themselves . " Alice in Acidland " keeps it all a little sleazier and more easy-going , though . Apparently , all that LSD does is stimulating young and innocent girls to have random sex with strangers ; whether guys that nickname themselves Animal or fellow naughty girls . As you can guess , " Alice in Acidland " is merely just an excuse to show a series of gratuitous soft-porn sequences and delirious color-effects . The set-up is similar to the one of " Reefer Madness " , with a voice-over narration from a psychiatrist and the poor intoxicated Alice herself . That is kind of weird , since the end of the movie clearly states that the LSD messed up poor Alice beyond repair , so how would she be able to narrate her version ? There's absolutely no dialog in the entire film , presumable to save the viewer some really terrible performances , but the ladies are quite luscious and keep the sex footage at least endurable . 55 minutes might seem incredibly short for a long feature film , but believe you me , in the case of " Alice in Acidland " is more than long enough and perhaps even a bit overlong .
Hey . . . I thought we " Saw " " Hostel " already ?	Some gorehound-friends recommended " Live Feed " to me , and basically I can't really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze , but it is of course not a very good film . More than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema , the so-called Torture Porn , Ryan Nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre ( and that includes the role models " Hostel " and " Saw " ) with its sick & twisted make-up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co-eds tried up , suffering and begging for their lives . There's no actual plot to describe . Five utterly brainless twenty-something friends take a trip to Asia . One of them has Asian roots , but other than that I don't really know why they opted to travel there instead of to Cancun . They're clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market . The quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan . A simply apology clearly doesn't suffice , as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture . One girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat ; yikes . " Live Feed " is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook , even if you're used to watching independent fan-boy trash cinema like this . The fat bloke depicted on the cover , an oriental S & M executioner , is admittedly quite cool and he's also the most talented of the whole bunch , because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time . I wouldn't exactly recommend this pile of filth , but hey , if you like loud & hideous metal music , nauseating torture footage and dim-witted losers , go right ahead and watch !
Sickening amateur-trash !	What an absolutely repulsive , shameless and thoroughly depraved short movie this is ! I've been a fan of horror and cult-cinema my entire life , yet I have never encountered something this demented and ? sadly ? pointlessly exploitative . Sick puppy Joe Christ ( who apparently ran for Governor of Texas once ) entirely centers his short story on one of the only topics that is probably better off remaining a taboo , namely the ( sexual ) violation of handicapped people . The film opens with obese and bed-ridden woman Margaret Petrov yelling at her Gothic-dressed teenage nurse because her diaper needs to be changed . The young girl is very mean against her and eventually abandons her . Only two weeks later , the woman gets a new nurse . He ( writer / director Joe Christ ) initially acts helpful and friendly , but pretty soon her puts little statues of Hitler in the woman's room and abuses her . The short film ends with the sick bastard raping the paraplegic woman and killing her by stuffing her mouth full of newspapers . " Crippled " is totally sickening underground-short movie , poorly put together and badly acted . The idea might be disturbing as hell , but the elaboration is too amateurish to be genuinely shocking . What brings certain people to make movies like this , I don't know . But , even more importantly , why do other watch them ?
Like a video game . . .	Almost everything in this redundant but nevertheless slightly amusing straight-to-video sequel to " House on Haunted Hill " looks like it is part of a video game . The title sounds like a typical video game title , none of the characters ( not even the good ones ) are amiable and / or given any backgrounds and there's no real plot ; just a lot of gory massacres and CGI-bloodshed . Okay , admittedly , there was absolutely no reason to make a sequel to a remake of the late 50's William Castle / Vincent Price classic , but that doesn't mean it can't be mildly entertaining , right ? If you're only hoping to see a lot of carnage , girls with impressive cleavage and sinister grimaces on good old horror pal Jeffrey Combs ' face , you won't regret spending your money on a rental . The plot is weak and , in fact , shamelessly ruining the premise of the original . All of a sudden , an ancient statue of the Baphomet religion is the cause of all evil inside the house on haunted hill . Dr . Vannacutt once brought the statue to his clinic and promptly metamorphosed from a good-hearted , Nobel Price winning doctor into a mad-raving psychopath who performed sadistic experiments on his patients until they revolted . The valuable statue is supposedly still hidden inside the house and a group of archeology students and their teacher as well as a bunch of greedy art thieves breaks into the house on the same night . The house , and all its ghosts including lesbian wardens , welcomes its visitors with open ? doors . " Return to the House etc ? " is a straightforward low-budget horror film , meaning director Victor Garcia doesn't spend too much time on building up suspense or detailed character drawings ( the running time is too short for that , anyway ) , but the murder sequences are creative and over-the-top nasty fun to behold . One of the girls ' facial skin is peeled off , another one's head is crushed by a refrigerator ( yes ! ) , a guy is totally disemboweled and the smut-highlight of the film involves someone getting torn to little pieces using bed sheets ! The effects are all digitally realized with a computer . I'm usually not a fan of CGI , but it didn't bother me because my expectations were already set low anyway . Horror veteran Jeffrey Combs was clearly just interested in his paycheck , as he hasn't got much screen time in the script and not even any lines . But his lack of interest is widely compensated by the presence of luscious beauties Amanda Righetti and Cerina Vincent . Surely this film is a generally inferior product and it doesn't come close to the quality-level of the original , which actually only was a mediocre horror film , but it is undemanding entertainment . Recommended to easily satisfied horror fanatics and to fans of violent video games .
What the HELL ? ! ?	Percival Rubens ' " The Demon " is one of them late 70's low-budget horror oddities of which you can't help wondering why the hell it was ever made . What director , in his right state of mind , comes up with a completely illogical story about a malicious killer with unexplained motives and a heroic copper who gets killed even long before he's face-to-face with his nemesis ? And this describes just a small part of everything that is wrong with the film's screenplay . There's a sadistic killer on the loose in a small town . He wears gloves with claws attached to them , yet he exclusively kills his victims by choking them with a plastic bag . He always seems to walk in the shadow , has the size of a giant and never speaks a word . Is he really a demon ? or just a frustrated outcast who never received any motherly love ? He seems to be after the local kindergarten teacher and her gorgeous cousin but why is anyone's guess . On the other side , we have an ex-cop gifted with psychic powers looking for the killer . Cameron Mitchell ( " Blood and Black Lace " , " Nightmare in Wax " ) truly makes a fool out of himself here , pretending to be in contact with higher forces and sniffing a missing girl's pillow for clues . He's smart enough to predict his own death , yet he doesn't take any efforts to prevent it . As you can see , the plot is one giant MESS and there's absolutely nothing that makes the slightest bit of sense . The only positive point I can raise is that " The Demon " benefits from a neat morbid atmosphere and an occasional flash or sheer suspense . It's also quite sleazy ! The two lead girls regularly strip all their clothes off but this doesn't seem to influence the madman in any way . On the contrary , he's more interested in tearing apart the dressing gowns than in naked female bodies . Like I said , it's a bad bad bad BAD film ? but curiously intriguing at the same time .
Let's All Go to Die in the Lakes ' Lake !	The organizing department behind the After Dark Horrorfest clearly didn't base their movie choices on plot originality ; otherwise " Lake Dead " never would have made the final selection . This is a remotely entertaining little effort , but quite possibly also the most clichéd horror movie I ever watched and it's derivative of at least a dozen genre classics , including " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " ( original and remake ) , " Friday the 13th " , " Psycho " and " The Hills have Eyes ( original and remake as well ) . Every prototypic twist you expect to happen in a backwoods horror slasher really does happen here , and at the exact moment you predicted it too , and every stereotypical character you anticipate to make an appearance also really does make an appearance at one point or another . Personally I have a high level of tolerance for the use of dreadful clichés , but if you're exclusively looking for horror movies with innovating and daringly creative formulas feel free to skip this one , because it features absolutely nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before . The plot primarily revolves on two attractive blond sisters , Brielle and Kelly Lake . Their last name is either a lack of scripting inspiration or a truly lame pun , because they actually inherit a lake and complementary lakeside motel somewhere in the middle of hillbilly nowhere . The girls gather a group of horny friends and decide to go camping in the area they inherited . Needless to say the testament was only a trick to lure the girls back to their family's roots , where they're required to continue an uncannily bizarre family tradition . There's a revival of backwoods / inbred redneck horror movies going on lately , but somehow these newer films can't accomplish the raw and nihilistic atmosphere of their 70's colleagues . " Lake Dead " tries hard , but the film never evokes the slightest frights and not even the explicit gore has a shocking impact . The bloody make-up effects are nifty , but there's too little variation in the characters ' deaths and the film definitely also needed a couple of authentically perverted gimmicks . Incestuous sub plots and maniacal old ladies don't upset anyone anymore nowadays , so " Lake Dead " is actually rather soft by today's standards . The film stars an impressive number of sexy chicks ( Kelsey Crane , Tara Gerard , Malea Richardson ? ) , but I sincerely doubt long and fruitful careers are awaiting any of them . Oh , and now that our list of little complaints is quite long already , I don't think the titular lake actually qualifies as a lake . It's more like an over-sized pond , if you ask me .
Semi-successful maniacal portrait . . .	First and foremost : I feel they ought to make " Nightmare in a Damaged Brain " the official title of this movie . It has got such a cool ring to it , and simply calling it " Nightmare " is insignificant anyways ! That said . . . on with the review ! Scavolini's film actually is a decent film and not quite as disgusting as you might fear . It sort of follows into the footsteps of " Maniac " and mixes bloody massacres with a more deeper portrait of a deranged psycho . The intelligent plot-aspects regretfully are poorly elaborated and this causes a lack of tension , involvement and a slow rate . Too bad , because the genuinely creepy opening sequence increased my expectations . Baird Clifford ( a completely unknown and unexperienced actor ) plays a terrific lead , though ! His diabolical charisma really fits his character well and - occasionally - you could even compare his portrayal with what Michael Rooker did for " Henry : Portrait of A serial Killer " . A very strong advantage , but it just can't save the film from oblivion . Would I still recommend it ? Yes , I do . . . even if it were only to see Tom Savini's great work in the make-up department . There's some sick violence featuring in this film that'll certainly appeal to gorehounds .
" The Indecent Girls That We Are "	Okay , first and foremost , there's something very wrong with the US-title of this thing . High School ? ? Hitch-Hikers ? ? ? The two leading ladies are way too old to still be in high school and ? even more importantly ? they never at one point during the movie stick up their thumbs to fetch a ride with someone ! The original French title literally translates ( as you could probably guess ) as " Impudent Young Girls " but I presume even that wasn't sleazy enough for the American Grindhouse circuit . That being said , onwards with the actual movie review even though there isn't that much to write . This really feels like an adult movie with the adult bits cut out . Only a porn flick is allowed to have such a flimsy plot because there's the hardcore footage to compensate for it . But , of course , if you leave out the sex you're stuck with a nonsensical wraparound story . And that's exactly what " High School Hitch-Hikers " is : a silly wraparound story with sleaze and a lot of nudity , but no actual fornication . Two traveling and gorgeous young girls , one blond and one brunette , break into a seemingly abandoned mansion to spend the night , unaware it's the hideout place of a jewelery thief and his loot . They meet , have sex and when the girls leave again the next morning the thief notices his stolen jewels are missing . He and his dim-witted accomplices abduct the girls and submit them to " torture " . However , the brunette escapes and turns to a private detective for help . Admittedly the basic plot description doesn't even sound so bad , but the elaboration is truly too inept and hilariously moronic to put into words . Here's a brief listing of my personal favorite aspect that don't make the slightest bit of sense : the kidnappers ' idea of torturing the girls exists of cutting off their hair and ? if that doesn't work ? kidnapper number one ( who looks a lot like Tom Savini ) caresses their bodies and tenderly makes love to them ! Oh , the cruelty ! The mansion supposedly lies in a remote area , yet when the brunette escapes she reaches civilization and even a private detective before the others even notice she's gone . The private detective talks like Inspector Clouseau ( or at least in the dubbed version he does ) and does literally nothing useful . His idea of solving the mystery is to wait in the mansion and have breakfast . During the shootout outside the mansion , none of the four participants get hurt even though they don't bother looking for cover . At one point , one of the accomplices just runs away and doesn't return . Yup , " High School Hitch-Hikers " is an astonishingly bad movie but at the same time quite entertaining from a Grindhouse-experience point of view . The gals are incredibly hot and have exquisite bodies , the typical porn-flick soundtrack is catchy and all the stupidity is oddly relaxing to watch . Personally , I've never been a fan of Jean Rollin's acclaimed and supposedly cult-tastic lesbian vampire flicks , like " Lips of Blood " , " The Living Dead Girl " or " Shiver of the Vampire " . I prefer this movie because it's playful and unpretentious , whereas his usual movies are melancholic and wannabe artistic . At least films like " High School Hitch-Hikers " and the infamous " Zombie Lake " establish what Jean Rollin really is : a smutty Euro-trash director and NOT a visionary and gifted filmmaker .
You Choo-Choo-Choose Me ?	I heard and read many praising things about " Midnight Meat Train " , which is based on a short story written by no less than Clive Barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original " Hellraiser " that he directed himself , but so far I can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience . The most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is : nauseating ! The violence is sadistic and extreme , which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts , but it's also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative . Normally speaking , I'm very pro-violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose . The butchering ? literally ? depicted in " Midnight Meat Train " is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs , and even that isn't fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects . There are more shortcomings , some even bigger than the pointless gore , but perhaps I should focus on the good elements first . The basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences ( like the chase in the freezer room , for example ) are literally oozing with nail-biting suspense and macabre atmosphere . Unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted . Presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities , but I honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by Vinnie Jones . The plot introduces Leon , an aspiring photographer in New York whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures . Leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train . Leon's right , as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer , but the killer's motivations and behavior suggest there's something far more substantial going on the rails at night . " Midnight Meat Train " takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs , plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images ( like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood ) , but director Ryûhei Kitamura ( " Versus " , " Godzilla Final Wars " ) doesn't take full advantage of it all . The ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and , even if Clive Barker meant to have like this , I still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale . " Midnight Meat Train " is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film , but not without defaults . It's not intended for easily offended viewers , but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well .
Children Shouldn't Play Deadly Games .	I'm always tempted to reward these movies from Northern Europe with some extra points , simply because the languages they speak over there are so utterly cool ! Just look at this film's title , with the remarkable " o " , and listen to some of the monologues ! Even the most awful teen-slasher suddenly gets a whole lot more sinister with an odd title like this . The truth is , however , that this Danish attempt to cash in on the successful slasher-formula doesn't deserve to get any extra points . " Morkeleg " ? internationally released as " Backstabbed " ? is an incredibly unoriginal and mundane thriller that compares with the overload of slashers released in the States during the 80's . We've got a bunch of teenagers gathering in an old abandoned mansion to play a game in which they have to hunt and pretend to kill each other with fake knives . Naturally , the fun stops when a real maniac joins the party and actual blood flows through the corridors . The best thing I can possibly say about the film is that director Martin Schmidt occasionally manages to create a genuinely creepy and ominous atmosphere . The scenes in which an unseen culprit stalks the boys & girls up & down the stairs and through the dusty corridors are fairly unsettling and the actual murders are pleasingly gore . However , it's really easy to figure out the killer's identity and the red herrings attempting to mislead the viewers are laughably ineffective . The acting performances are okay , I guess . I've never heard of any of these Danish stars but I suppose they're popular in their home country and do a reasonably convincing job in their first horror roles . One of the characters keeps talking to his own finger , on which he has drawn a cute face and refers to as ' little piggy ' . That was odd .
I Vant To Suk Your . . . SANGRE !	The most interesting thing about the Spanish version of Dracula is the modest & informative introduction of main actress Lupita Tovar . I don't know when exactly this brief interview with her was shot , but it can't be too long ago judging by the picture quality , which makes it all the more impressive that she still looks relatively good ! According to the IMDb , she's still alive and kicking , though nearly reaching the age of 100 and not having made any movies in more than 60 years . With great pride , Tovar explains how the Spanish crew exclusively worked during the nights , using the exact same sets of the English version , how the director didn't understood the language of his cast & crew and ? most notably ? how her costumes and wardrobes were a lot sexier and more revealing than those of her English speaking colleagues . Interesting ! She also claims that the Spanish version is superior and that is , of course , debatable since many of the plot lines seem unnecessarily stretched and on the verge of being very tedious . The story is exactly the same , but this version pays more attention to the extended drawing of characters that are merely supportive , like Renfield for example . The film eventually runs half an hour longer than its English counterpart , 104 minutes in total , and that is simply too long for a horror movie of that era . Part of the Universal monster movies ' charm is that they are short , straightforward and to the point . " Drácula " is the first , and to my knowledge , only contemporary Universal movie that features needless padding . Naturally Carlos Villarias is no patch on Bela Lugosi when it comes to depicting the legendary infamous Count . Lugosi literally owned the character ; whereas Villarias is hardly menacing at all and most of the time he appears to pull funny grimaces and sneering expressions . There are so numberless versions of Bram Stoker's immortal novel available on the market , so I'm not entirely sure why Universal didn't simply dub the American version instead of producing yet another different film , but it still has many fans . And it made Mrs . Lupita Tovar proud to be an actress , which is a good thing as well , I guess .
Gore comedy , hung together by absurdity . . . Good or bad depends on your own personal mood .	Monster Man is a small and modest production , made by a bunch of people who're obvious genre-lovers and ambitious fantasts . I really can't be too harsh on it as the goodwill and enthusiasm of both cast and crew can count on my sympathy a lot more than the uninspired and plot and messy script . Unoriginal is one thing this film surely is since it borrows ideas from films like Spielberg's Duel , The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , the Hills have Eyes and even Jeepers Creepers ! ! Seriously , why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like Jeepers Creepers is a complete mystery to me , but still ? The plot involves two lowlifes ( a male virgin nerd and a boisterous , chubby joker ) who're on their way to wedding of a girl they both worshiped in their youth . They pick up the inevitable hitch-hiking sexy babe , which leads to new cliché intricacies . Meanwhile , they're being terrorized by this huge Monster Truck , driven by a ghoulish and severely mutilated madman . The make-up effects in this film are playfully gore and the bloodshed is very explicit ? Heads and limbs are cheerfully being crushed under the giant wheels of the truck and numberless ' roadkill'-corpses appear out of nowhere . The comedy-horror approach of this film reminds you about other memorable titles such as Evil Dead II , Braindead and The Return of the Living Dead ? however , I severely doubt that Monster Man will ever enjoy the same status in the field like the previously mentioned titles do . The extremely far-fetched and stupid climax is a bit too much and hard to swallow , even though I was in a generously mild and open-minded mood . Even for an absurd comedy , Monster Man has a dumb ending and that's a shame because the previous 80minutes are a well-intentioned attempt . Oh well ? Monster Man will certainly be appreciated by young and over-enthusiast gorehounds and cinema thrillseekers ? The more trained and experienced horror fans can keep themselves busy by tracking down the references and tributes to classic horror delights ? . IF they're in a good mood , of course .
Singing , Dancing , Imitating and Bloodsucking all over the World !	This is exactly the type of stuff you expect the good people over at Mondo Macabro to release under their formidable DVD-label : Obscure , horror-themed curiosities from all over the globe ! These movies aren't necessarily good , but definitely unique in some way and they at least always feature aspects that appeal to avid cult collectors . This particular oddity , for example , is a Pakistani vampire movie ( how many of those do you know ? ) and it's one of the only horror films ever to be heavily censored not because of the horrific subject matter but because the female characters act & dress too provocatively ! The Mondo Macabro DVD restores all the cut footage in which the women dance " too " sensually , although sometimes you wish it hadn't because these parts are overlong , dreary and serve absolutely no purpose . The story introduces Rehan ( interesting how some of these actors have last names and others don't ) as an overly ambitious scientist striving to become immortal . He develops an elixir that does the job , but the side effects involve an allergy to daylight , pointy teeth and the incontrollable hunger for human blood . In short , the poor man transforms into a vampire ( although he doesn't seem to mind ) and nobody in a large area around his mansion is longer safe , especially not when he sets his mind to drinking the blood of Dr . Aqil's beautiful fiancée . The first half of the story is involving and occasionally even atmospheric & suspenseful , but then it turns into a dull family drama with hardly any noteworthy moments , apart from the virulent man vs . vampire showdown in the end . The popular title " Dracula in Pakistan " is obviously the best choice for marketing purposes , but " The Living Corpse " is of course far more accurate since there's no actual blood relation between Professor Tabani and the legendary count of Bram Stoker's novel . The film does try really hard to be reminiscent to " Dracula " , however . The main star , Rehan , could easily pass for Christopher Lee's brother from another ( Pakistani ) mother , the " brides " also look familiar and the script even bluntly copies famous quotes that are irreversibly linked to the original Dracula ( " Children of the Night ? What music they make " ) . In fact , the absolute most suitable title for this movie would be " The Pakistani Vampire Musical " . There really are a LOT of musical interludes . Some of the songs are truly misfit ( La Cucaracha in a horror film ? ) , others are sexy ( the bride's dance to a song that sounds like " The Shadows " ) and just plain goofy ( the women's overlong beach song ) , but they practically all are redundant and exclusively added to stretch the running time . " The Living Corpse " is a curious find for people with a wide interest in global cult cinema , but not necessarily fundamental viewing for horror fanatics .
Jess the Rip-off artist .	Like the case with many of his films , it's not very clear to me what exactly Jess Franco intended to accomplish with his very personal interpretation of the notorious tale of London serial killer Jack The Ripper . This film is probably the least accurate re-telling of the facts and also the narrative style is rather unusual . Foremost , Franco's " Jack the Ripper " was entirely shot in Switzerland and , even though he really tried to imitate the dark and fog-enshrouded late-Victorian alleys and typically British working-class pubs , the settings simply aren't convincing . Never at one point you have the impression that the events takes place in England and so this production is already fatally implausible to begin with . The ripper's modus operandi for committing the murders and dumping the bodies is also different and completely fictionalized . Since when did Jackie-boy take the dead prostitutes home with him to perform autopsies or relied on his retarded housekeeper to dump the remainders in a river ? To my recollection the victims ' bodies never left the scene of the crime , as the Ripper wanted the authorities to find them instantly in order to raise fear and mayhem . Most of all , this is probably the only version of Jack the Ripper in which his identity gets revealed immediately and the plot even makes assumptions about what started his urge to kill & mutilate luscious women . Of course , if the DVD-cover proudly advertises Klaus Kinski's name and scary face , there isn't much mystery left regarding the culprit's identity . He's the creepy maniac responsibly , period . The most logical explanation is probably the correct one : Jess Franco had absolutely no intentions of making a complex and convoluted whodunit-thriller , but simply wanted a straightforward exploitation flick with sleaze and violence , and since Jack The Ripper is a topic that is guaranteed to raise giant profits at the box-office , he stole it . Good old Jess , always in the mood to shamelessly exploit moneymaking trends ! But it has to be said that " Jack The Ripper " easily ranks among Franco's most effective and memorable efforts ! Mainly thanks to the presence of the incredibly charismatic and phenomenal Klaus Kinski ( even when he's clearly uninterested in a role , he still delivers ! ) , but also the actual film doesn't contain as many pointless & tedious scenes as usual in Franco's productions . The extended murder sequences , and particularly the aftermaths , are downright sickening and misogynistic , with graphic amputations and mutilations of intimate body parts . The make-up effects are realistic enough to upset your stomach , so gorehouds will definitely get a kick out of watching this film . The music by Walter Baumgartner adds some genuine suspense to the lackluster story and there occasionally even is some impressive camera-work to enjoy . Far from brilliant , but nevertheless interesting viewing for admirers of Jess Franco , Klaus Kinski , the sexy Lina Romey ( in a small role as one of the victims ) and " Ripperologists " in general .
In Space No One Can Hear You ? . Transform into a hideously gooey one-eyed monster !	I'll admit that " First Man into Space " is a pretty bad film , mainly because the creators made the huge mistake of trying to give a hideous monster a voice and emotions , but still I can't help appreciating this British low budget late 50's Sci-Fi horror effort . The reasons for this are almost exclusively linked to the fabulous make-up effects and the brutality of the killings . Despite the fact that they want you to empathize with the monster , the murders it commits are extremely gruesome ( involving throat-slitting , blood-drinking and that sort of things ? ) . You can imagine it's pretty difficult , and actually even a bit ridiculous , to have sentiments for a one-eyed pile of smut that just tore apart the throat of an innocent trucker and drank the blood of cows . The plot of " First Man into Space " is fairly rudimentary , as are the set pieces and scenery . The footage of the intergalactic journeys and the interiors of the spacecrafts & laboratories look extremely cheesy by today's standards , but they were top-notch equipment during the late 50's , when the popularity of the Sci-Fi genre literally boomed . The plot itself often feels like a low-keyed imitation of one of Hammer Studio's greatest successes , namely " The Quatermass Experiment " . If you , like me , consider that particular film to be one of the greatest landmarks of 50's Sci-Fi , you'll definitely also find some entertainment in the derivative concept of " First Man into Space " . The story revolves on a cocky astronaut who desperately aspires to become the first man into space no matter what . With a stubborn attitude like that , he naturally disobeys important orders from ground control ( his brother ) and puts himself in great danger . His first flight has a happy ending but during a second flight his capsule vanishes from all radars . The astronaut is still alive , however he transformed into a hideous monster that craves blood and slowly heads back to base camp . The first half of the film is overly talkative and every single stereotype and cliché regarding space exploration also features in the script . There's the helpless love-interest , torn between the two brothers , the elderly pipe smoking scientists and ? of course ? the inevitable hammy monologues where one of the characters lifts up his head and stares into space while saying something like : " Perhaps we're still too small to comprehend the secrets and menaces of the great universe " . It's not an exact quote , but you get the big picture . The middle section of the script compensates for most of the flaws , as the film temporarily turns into a good old-fashioned monster-on-the-rampage spectacle with suspense and bloody killings . The silliness reaches an absolute highlight when the monster ( which only has one eyeball and even that hangs out of its socket ) is shown driving a car with the bloodied corpse of a woman in the passenger's seat . The final sequences are pure sentimental baloney and not exactly the type of anti-climax die-hard fans of the genre prefer to see , but what the hell . The least you can say about " First Man into Space " is that it's an admirable effort .
Everybody was Kung Fu splattering ? HO !	A righteous first impression after seeing this movie would be : ' WHAT THE HELL ? ! ? ' Lai Wong most likely is different than all the movies you ever saw before . But all in good fun , that is . The Story of Ricki ( the more popular a . k . a title ) is an outsider in an already eccentric sub-genre of Asian horror . Exaggerated and ultra-gory splatter films based on Manga comics . Ricki-Oh is a 21-year-old Bruce Lee clone who battles against the corruption in futuristic , privatized prisons and acts like some sort of Kung Fu Robin Hood . His fists and feet cause serious damage to his opponents and every fight results in cheerful bloodshed . We're talking skull crushing , limb amputations and worse ! There even is a scene in which a guard is strangled by his own intestines . This all may sound very distasteful ( and it kinda is ) , but above all it's funny ! Well , morbid-funny that is . I can imagine not everybody laughs hysterically with the idea of a fat , green-dressed retard feasting over the sight of tortured prisoners . But trust me , if you're sense of humor is as black as hell itself ? you'll have a great time . The gore and violence in Lai Wong is never provocative or offensive . The grotesque butchering never really becomes nauseating and ? compared to other strong Asian stuff like ' The Ebola Syndrome ' and ' Men Behind the Sun ' ? you never feel dirty for enjoying the sickness .
a bucket of gore , anyone ? ? ?	I found this film , hidden deep in my closet of horror . Without having any clue what so ever I began watching it . After the first 10 minutes , the face of 4 people were already ripped off . I'm always up for a bit of gore so I left it on . Afterwards , when I looked it up here , It seemed to be a part of the Zombi-series , brought to us originally by Lucio Fulci . . . makes sense . So , it's also known as : Zombi 4 or " Oltre la morte " . . . and about a million other aka's . Italian zombie films are always fun . Even though they all start to look alike , you just keep on watching them . I don't know why that is actually . It's just a common thing . The make up is gore enough but the music is disturbing ( especially the rock ballads ) . The story ? OK , a group of soldiers ( sort of ) are caught on an island . On this same island , a curse has been spoken by a witchdoctor upon a group of scientists 20 years ago . One little girl escaped and now she's back on the island ( what are the odds on that , huh ) The zombies are still dwelling around and hunt down the now grown up girl and her friends . That's it . . . don't tell me you expected more . One more thing . The leading actors name is Jeff Stryker ( he also has several aka's ) Does that name means anything to you ? If not , you're a good boy / girl because Mr . Stryker is an adult actor . According to his biography , this is the only non-adult film that he ever made . . . Zombies and porn , that's a hell of a resumé if you ask me .
How much Troma-Trash can you handle ?	Purely talking in terms & standards of Troma Film Productions , " The Toxic Avenger " is almost like a true masterpiece ! It's a fast-paced and immensely entertaining smutfest , stuffed with grotesquely gooey make-up effects , politically incorrect situations and ridiculously absurd toilet-humor that somehow puts a giant smile on your face despite being unspeakably awful ! The plot borrows the clichéd elements of average 80's teen-slashers , as a constantly bullied moron , working as a cleaner in the Tromaville's fitness center , is hurled in a barrel of radioactive toxic waste after one-too-many juvenile pranks . However , he emerges again as a horribly deformed and 7 ft . tall superhero still wielding his mop , only now to fight crime and wreak havoc on all those who mistreated him . The crime scenes Toxie encounters are extremely offensive , but at the same time irresistibly hilarious because they're so over the top ! A clique of hyperactive teenagers randomly drive their car over the faces of children on bicycles ( " Death Race 2000 " - style ) , crazed robbers aim their guns at little babies and guide dogs for the blind and old ladies are beaten up with their own canes . The gore effects surely are nauseating , but never really unsettling or shocking . Naturally , there's also tons of rancid sleaze and embarrassingly bad jokes on display and witty dialogs are the last thing you should expect in a script written by Joe Ritter and Lloyd Kaufman . The last fifteen minutes are rather tame in comparison with the rest of the film , because the two had already run out of ideas . Overall , " The Toxic Avenger " , as well as the entire Troma-repertoire , represents the lowest form of horror film-making , but it can be fun when watched in the right mental state of mind .
Derivative , but mildly entertaining slasher	This abnormally obscure early 90's slasher ( it's nearly impossible to find ) attempts to blend different styles and sub genres , like desert horror , textbook teen-slasher and psychological thriller . The story's main influence obviously comes from the stalking - vehicles - without - a - driver classics , namely " The Car " and Steven Spielberg's " Duel " , but the atmosphere and especially the final plot-twists are more reminiscent to wannabe intellectual thrillers , which is quite a shame . Personally , I'm convinced " Mirage " would have been much more efficient without the pseudo-psychological end twists . As the title implies , the script wants you to constantly doubt whether or not the terrorizing black pick-up truck is real or simply a mirage . The structure doesn't really work and the film honestly isn't very good , but at least the straightforward action sequences and gory deaths make it worthwhile . Three young couples , stereotype hot girls and hunky boys , head out to the middle of the desert to go camping , play stupid ball games and have a whole lot of sex ; preferably in driving vehicles ( excellent opening sequence ) . Right from the beginning , and for no apparent reason , there's a sinister black pick-up truck with heavy lights following them around and observing their every move . Using the malevolent car as a powerful weapon , the teenagers are quickly wiped out and pretty soon Chris is the only one left to confront the psycho behind the wheel . The death sequences are ingenious and suitably gory ( one poor bloke is dismembered when his legs are simultaneously chained to a tree and the vehicle ) and the desert setting easily creates the right atmosphere of helplessness . The acting performances are atrocious , but the girls are pretty and provide some welcome ? albeit totally gratuitous ? nudity . The pick-up truck is simply awesome and undeniably menacing . " Mirage " is good fun as long as you completely forget the last five minutes .
Everybody agrees ! Bava = Genius ! !	I must admit this isn't the world's most interesting documentary and it's mainly intended for audiences that already know Mario Bava was a genius filmmaker , so they can simply nod their head whenever his great influence on horror cinema is mentioned . However , it is interesting to see how many great nowadays directors are big fans of Bava too ! For example , I knew Quentin Tarantino loves pretty much everything that was obscure , foreign and released in the rancid 70's , but I didn't really know he's a Bava-admirer as well ! Or Tim Burton ! Ever since I first watched his " Sleepy Hollow " , I was secretly hoping Bava's influence contributed to the macabre atmosphere of that film and , apparently , it did ! " Operazione Paura " , which is also the original title of one of Bava's best horror films , is a series of sensational clips and short interviews , hosted by Joe Dante and covers pretty much all his horror movies except for " Hatchet for the Honeymoon " and , rather surprisingly , " Bay of Blood " . Naturally , a little more attention is given to Mario Bava's debut and ultimate masterpiece " Black Sunday " and the efforts that single-handedly launched a cult trend , like " Blood and Black Lace " , " The Girl Who Knew Too Much " and " Danger : Diabolik " . Then the documentary also centers on the director's most recognizable trademarks , like the vivid use of bright colors and the extreme ( over - ) use of camera zooms and close-ups . Everyone who means something in the Italian horror industry , from producer Dino De Laurentiis over to fellow director Dario Argento to legendary composer Ennio Morricone , comes to tell us why Mario Bava is generally considered to be the ' master of terror ' , while the American guys bring back memories how how they watched his films in cheap grindhouse theaters or drive-ins . It's not a very informative documentary , but it's a delight to see so many prominent people share their enthusiasm and admiration towards the greatest horror-director who ever lived .
If Freud would write Gialli screenplays . . .	I can't but concur wholeheartedly with pretty much everything that my fellow reviewer Lazarillo already wrote in his user-comment . " Eye in the Labyrinth " is an Italian Giallo that literally thrives on Freudian psycho-sexual gibberish , and if you don't " believe " in Sigmund Freud's analytical theories , chances are that you won't enjoy this movie for one bit . Personally I'm not a big supporter of psychology , but I do fancy everything which concerns early 70's and obscure Italian cult cinema so I still could at least moderately enjoy this film . The plot introduces Julie , an emotionally troubled young girl who starts her own private investigation in search for her psychiatrist that went missing . The trail leads to a fancy resort where her beloved doctor threw perverted sex parties and ran a whole lot of other illegal affairs . Julie gradually becomes entangled in a web of mystery , hallucinations and dead end clues , but still there's no trace of Louis the psychiatrist . As the plot of " Eye in the Labyrinth " slowly unfolds , the film raises confusion instead of to clarifying the events and it actually requires an extended monologue at the end in order to tie all the loose ends together . The denouement is fairly logical and acceptable , but it's definitely a whole lot of senseless nonsense and ? as said ? you need to switch on your Freudian mindset . " Eye in the Labyrinth " contains relatively few violence or imaginative murder sequences ( with the notable exception of one fantastic burning-car moment ) in comparison with most Italian Gialli of that period , but there's plentiful of sleaze and nudity to compensate . For example , a still very young Sybil Danning makes an appearance as one of the random topless murder victims and her presence alone forms a nice extra treat for avid cult purchasers .
Medieval Midget-Terminator	" Hmm , there's beautiful big money to make with horror movies about ugly little creeps ? " That's what writer / director Mark Jones must have thought after the release of " Leprechaun " in 1993 and , since other directors were already making sequels to his horror movie , he promptly started writing a script revolving on another midget committing nasty and gruesome deeds . There are quite a number of similarities between " Rumpelstiltskin " and " Leprechaun " , even aside from the titular characters ' short length . Both movies revolve on unworldly creatures ? one from the Irish mythology and the other a medieval fairy tale character ? being unleashed in modern civilized times . They're both fanatically searching for something that righteously belongs to them , whether it's a pot of gold or the soul of a firstborn baby , and they are eager to butcher a whole lot of people whilst firing off one cheesy and ludicrous one-liner after the other . I vividly remember reading and listening to the fairy-tale version of " Rumpelstiltskin " as a child . It was one of my favorite macabre stories , what with its 15th Century rural setting and a plot containing elements like child kidnapping and emotional blackmail . The film version opens in these dark medieval times , but then quickly jumps forth in time towards the violence-infested streets of LA in the 1990's . Rumpelstiltskin is locked away in a magic stone , but he's set free when a mourning mother sheds a tear on the stone and wishes for her recently killed husband to come back from the dead and meet their son . When the wish is granted , hideous little Uncle Rumpel ( as he hilariously refers to himself once or twice ) claims ownership of baby John . The rest of the film depicts Rumpelstiltskin chasing after mother , child and a TV host guy who says equally retarded stuff as the evil dwarf . " Rumpelstiltskin " is fairly enjoyable 90's horror shlock , but you obviously cannot expect a good or even half-decent movie . Mark Jones seemingly hesitated about what he wanted to achieve as well , as the opening sequences ( with the tragic death of a young policeman and his struggling being left behind at eight months of pregnancy ) are serious-toned and melodramatic , but then as soon as Rumpel shows his hideous face the movie turns into a fast-paced and almost slapstick type of horror comedy . The little creep pretends to be Arnold Schwarzenegger in " The Terminator " because he smokes big cigars and consecutively steals a heavy motorcycle and a gigantic petrol truck . There are a couple of imaginative killings , but don't expect any gore . Max Grodénchik isn't as menacing as Warwick Davis was in " Leprechaun " ? especially the voice isn't creepy enough ? but he definitely is ugly enough for the job . Lead actress Kim Johnston Ulrich is very good , but all her direct colleagues Tommy Blaze and particularly Allyce Beasley only evoke sentiments of irritation .
The Karloff of the Opera ?	Even though the legendary Boris Karloff gave image to hundreds of cinematic monsters , psychopaths and mad scientists , he never played the titular character in Gaston Leroux ' acclaimed masterwork " The Phantom of the Opera " . Other contemporary horror stars did , like Lon Chaney and Claude Rains . Perhaps this production was Universal's attempt to involve Karloff in a horrific opera film-production anyway , re-using the expensive sets of the Phantom-film that was released one year earlier . The story is set in a prominent Vienna opera building where Boris stars as the resident physician , Dr . Hohner , and successfully hides a dark secret from his friends and co workers . After a short intro and a truly well choreographed flashback , we learn who Dr . Hohner murdered his fiancée and upcoming star-singer Marcellina because he feared her magically developing voice would come between their relationship . Now , ten years later , the new promising singer Angela ? with a voice almost identical to Marcellina's ? arrives at the theater and once again awakens Hohner's maniacal lusts . He hypnotizes her into never singing again , but Angela's young and devoted lover Franz carries on battling to make Angela share her wondrous voice with the world . " The Climax " is a beautiful movie to look at , with the terrific use of color and a nearly endless amount of great decors , but it surely could have used a slightly better screenplay . It's a rather predictable film with very few action scenes and only a bit of old-fashioned , legitimate tension during the last 15 minutes . There are many marvelous yet overlong opera sequences , even a lot more than in the actual " Phantom of the Opera " , but they naturally slow down the film's pace and eventually even affect ( negatively ) the acting performances of Boris Karloff and Gale Sondergaard . It's an enjoyable mystery / thriller to a certain extent , but if you want to see Karloff at his most malicious , check out Val Lewton's " The Body Snatcher " or " Bedlam " .
Timmaaaaay !	Zebedy Colt really ought to have named his film " The Candy Bar Killer " , instead . " Unwilling Lovers " is a good title , but it sounds too poetic and pseudo-intellectual for something that is basically just a no-budget 70's porn movie . Besides , the title isn't even that accurate . The ' lovers ' are either dead ( oh yes , there's necrophilia ! ) or ? willing . The Candy Bar Killer would have been better because it captures the silly and grotesque atmosphere of the film much more . Anyways , I concur with my fellow reviewers around here in claiming that " Unwilling Lovers " is a rare 70's gem with some pretty twisted and sick-spirited story lines as well as an overload of graphic XXX-action . Writer / director Zebedy Colt granted himself the leading role , and he isn't too ashamed to show off his manliness , as the mentally handicapped redneck son Timmy . Considering his mental condition , I can't help being reminded of the demented South Park character with the same name , you know the boy who can't do anything except shout out his own name . Timmy lives in an isolated countryside mansion with his wheelchair bound mother , an exaggeratedly well-hung gardener and a housekeeper who's a bit of a S . L . U . T . Timmy spends a lot of time observing people having sex and then re-enacting what he saw , only his interpretation of foreplay is to murder them first . Although not realizing it , he always leaves a wrapping of his favorite candy bar next to his victims ' corpses , and the police and media quickly nickname him the Candy Bar Killer . The first couple of killings are an exciting murder of sex and violence , but the film rapidly just focuses on depicting hardcore pornography . By the time of the third murder , we just witness a couple having sex followed by Timmy storming at them with a sneering smile on his face and the picture then immediately cuts to a newspaper headline announcing " Another Candy Bar Killing " . There's few gore or bloodshed on display , presumably due to the lack of budget , but the tone of the film is often disturbing and sick . The idea of sexually provoking a mentally unstable person and luring into a threesome is rather perverted and socially incorrect , but at the same time it's one of the most efficient sequences in the film . The acting performances are surprisingly decent and convincing , especially Colt's depiction of the eerie retard . The adult content is stimulating as long as you remain aware of the fact this is a 70's effort , meaning the men & women are excessively haired and rather chubby . Hard to find , but worth tracing if you're interested in this sort of crazy stuff . Timmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay !
Who's your daddy ?	Exploitative cinema seemly is of all times ? Even in the classic and respectable 30's , whenever a slick producer saw the chance of making extra money of a certain success-formula , he took it . And righteously so ! Who could possibly blame director Ernest B . Schoedsack and his film crew for trying to gain some more dollars out the tremendous box office hit " King Kong " , released only 8 months earlier ? Unlike the milestone his daddy starred in , " Son of Kong " certainly isn't a must-see film , but it nonetheless remains an enjoyable , light-headed little film that still features all the nifty elements of its predecessor , only to a lesser degree . The mini-ape is still an engaging Willis O'Brien creation but his appearance is a lot more brief and comical . The story of this sequel supposedly takes place one month after King Kong climbed up the Empire State Building , and has Carl Denham ( Robert Armstrong reprises his role ) fleeing from all his New York creditors . He sails off to see and , along with a whole bunch of people that aren't worth introducing , he washes ashore Skull Island again where they encounter the son of King Kong . The film is never boring , but it's totally pointless and it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be adventurous or simply cute . Also , it's difficult to accept the character of Carl Denham as a hero all of a sudden , since he was the greedy bastard responsible for King Kong's downfall . Oh , and another thing ? I'm not a great biologist , but apes don't come crawling out of eggs as far as I know . So , assuming King Kong isn't a hermaphrodite , there should also be a Mother Kong somewhere ! Where the hell is she ? Wasn't her story interesting enough to tell ? Is she such an atypical female that she decided to stay out of the picture during the cinematic adventures of both her man and son ? Or maybe she went back to living with Mother-in-Law Kong when she noticed her husband fancied Fay Wray and followed her all the way to New York ? Now that's something to think about !
Who's Afraid of George W . ?	The value of Peter Medak's master degree in horror is debatable , since he only just directed one terrific classic in the genre ( " The Changeling " ) and one inferior but fun & gory sequel ( " Species II " ) , but he nevertheless delivered a worthwhile addition to the series ' second season . " The Washingtonians " has an original premise and a fairly large amount of suspenseful sequences , particularly during the first half hour when the outcome is still somewhat of a mystery . And unlike most other installments of this show , the concept has the courage to mildly provoke . The story revolves on George Washington being a bloodthirsty cannibal ? even with a preference for the flesh of young children and virgins ? and a small group of Virginian disciples are still practicing his murderous habits . Considering the first President of the United States is still ( and always ) seen as a genuine hero and founding father of the nation , " The Washingtonians " just might upset a handful of old-fashioned people here and there . Not too much , however , as the overall tone of the episode is as much blackly comical as it is creepy . In the basement of his recently deceased grandmother's house in Virginia , Mike Franks finds a note written by no other than George Washington himself . This could be a great historical discovery , wouldn't it be that the message is hugely disturbing and talks about the dismemberment & devouring of little children . When they hear about the note , the friendly old people in town promptly turn into hostile and menacing aggressors that won't hesitate to kill and eat Mike and his family in order to recover the note . " The Washingtonians " is adequately fast-paced and well directed . Highlight of the short film is unquestionably the scene in the local restaurant , where the elderly townsfolk outrageously & primitively munch large portions of red meat . Still , in a story revolving on cannibalism , I expected a bit more gore and slaughter . Johnathon Schaech is decent in the lead role , but the woman who played his wife Pam ( the largely unknown Venus Terzo ) impressed me a lot more . She's a talented beauty with a gorgeous rack . That might be an infantile and tasteless thing to say , but it's the truth .
National Geographic Channel meets Italian Sleaze	Sergio Martino's ' Mountain etc ' is somewhat an outcast in the notorious Italian field of cannibalism ? This film has a bit more style , depth and ? compared to such films as ' Cannibal Holocaust ' or ' Cannibal Ferox ' ? you don't necessarily feel the need to take a shower after seeing it . It's actually better to compare this film with old-fashioned adventure-movies , actually ? but with cannibals and a healthy dose of authentic Italian sleaze . Ursula Andress ( still the finest , most ravishing Bond girl to date ) stars as a strong woman who goes on an expedition , deep down the Guinean jungle , to search her missing husband . Her brother and another respected anthropologist ( Stacy Keach ) accompany her to ' Ra Ra Mu ' ? Roughly translated : the mountain of the Cannibal God , where a savage tribe still feasts on human flesh . The first hour of the film is slow , atmospheric and surprisingly educational ! Several sequences , portraying animal's hunting rituals , seem to come right out of a National Geographic broadcast and you're actually waiting for the voice-over to inform you more . The original , uncut release of Mountain of the Cannibal God contains a good share of violence and nudity , but it never becomes repulsive or nauseating . To be entirely honest : the ' horrible ' cannibal tribe actually is rather lame . So , the fact they're only appear in the movie after the first hour is a good thing ! Until then , you've got compelling adventure and Andress's ravishing body to keep you entertained . Highly recommended viewing !
Enjoyable Creature-Feature	Not a very original horror film , of course , but fairly entertaining and with a good tempo , this ' They Nest ' easily belongs to the better efforts in the recent revival of the horror sub-genre of creature features . It is stuffed with clichés and stereotypes but try not to let this ruin the fun too much . All the ingredients that guarantee 90 minutes of unpretentious B-movie amusement are there : The over-stressed surgeon Dr . Cahill goes to a remote Maine island to find some peace and to decorate the old house he bought there . The hillbillies-inhabitants immediately hate him ( except for the local beauty , naturally . . . ) and , on top of all , a lethal cockroach-plague infests the island . These nasty little bugs turn out carnivores and use humans as hosts for their offspring ! The cause and origin of the killer-roaches isn't really explained ( no endless biological speeches or mutant-conspiracies this time ) and the film obviously lacks a solid screenplay . On the other hand it features a fair amount of suspense and eeriness without going over the top with gore effects . I'm sure that people with a phobia for small , crawling insects will have trouble watching several atmospherically shot scenes . . . . And that the best compliment you can get when delivering a horror film ! The writers were even clever enough to insert some humor to put the whole killer-bug situation a bit into perspective . The abrupt ending is so silly it almost becomes brilliant ! Ellory Elkayem once again turns out an above-average genre director . His atmospheric short film " Larger than Life " was very promising and with this film he proves being capable of directing bigger projects . Immediately after this , he moved on to the big-budget work with " Eight Legged Freaks " . Melrose Place pretty-boy Thomas Calabro is rather decent in the lead role but the show is obviously stolen by Dean Stockwell and - especially - John Savage , who stars as local nutball n # 1 . " They Nest " is a horror film worth watching and I'd even say it deserves a rating slightly higher than the one given on this site . If you really think it stinks , you should compare it with similar films made over the last few years . Compared to some of the junk found in video stores , this is quite a decent flick . If you're intrigued by the ugly creepiness of cockroaches , I also recommend checking out the 80's delight " The Nest " .
Creepy and intense . . . a very effective thriller ! !	Patrick is a very underappreciated and often overlooked thriller from " Down Under " . Yet , it's very intense and solid and - above all - pretty well made . I think it's one of those examples that proves you don't necessarily have to dispose of a huge budget to make an interesting movie . Just a solid plot idea and a lot of creativity will get the job done . Patrick was directed by someone named Richard Franklin . That name immediately rang a bell inside my head and I checked out his name as soon as I finished watching Patrick . Turns out this was the same guy who directed Psycho 2 and , suddenly , a whole lot of things got clarified . When you're watching Patrick , you don't have to be a detective to notice Franklin has got a huge Alfred Hitchkock fetish . Many references and tributes are made to " The Master of Suspense " . It somehow gives an extra value to this movie , I think . ( By the way , I thought Psycho II was a very decent movie as well and a worthy sequel to Hitchkock's masterpiece ) SPOILERS At the age of 21 , Patrick kills his mother and her lover . For a never fully explained reason , he got into a coma afterwards and stays in a private hospital ever since . He's kept alive by machines but they're keeping him alive , hoping to solve the mystery of live and death . He's being watched and a new nurse - a recently separated young woman - succeeds in building up some sort of relationship with him . Over the years , Patrick has developed the sixth sens of psychokineses . While laying in his bed , he terrorizes every man who comes too close to " his " nurse . END SPOILERS Patrick doesn't use many special and / or make up effects and when it does , it looks cheap . I'll admit that . But the power of this movie merely is in the slowly built up sequences of terror . For example , the sequence where the electricity is cut off and Patrick slowly turns his head towards the nightshift nurse is a terrific piece of suspense . The creepy atmosphere of the ancient hospital is always hanging around and this effect is even stengthened by the solid musical score . Also , I was very pleasantly surprised by the acting performances in Patrick . Especially Dr . Roget ( Robert Helpmann ) and the head-nurse ( María Mercedes - - - nice name by the way ) left quite an impression on me . I even think the leading actress ( Susan Penhaligon ) deserves to be mentioned . I also liked her a lot in Soldaat van Oranje . And last but certainly not least . . . Patrick contains a few very funny sequences . Not the ordinary slapstick of course but subtle and twisted humor that not everybody appreciates . Personally , I had a big grin on my face when the head-nurse explained to Kathy what kind of applicants her private hospital attracts . . . but I can image not everyone thinks that's funny . In conclusion . . . Well done , Australia ! ! I already knew they have the ability to make great cult films ( ever since I saw " The Cars that Ate Paris " ) and Patrick proves this statement once again . I'm now desperately trying to find the sequel " Patrick Still Lives " , even though I have no idea what to expect from that . Anyone here who recommends that one ?
Walking , Tripping , Balding and Going Mental on Sunshine !	Jeff Lieberman is unquestionably one of the most fascinating filmmakers active in the field of horror and peculiar cult . The movies he accomplished are versatile and difficult to categorize , and the man himself is a rather unusual persona as well . I read a couple of interviews in which Lieberman claims not to be a fan of the genre at all and in case his films are reminiscent of others ( for example " Just Before Dawn " to " Texas Chainsaw Massacre " ) , it must be purely coincidental , as he states never to have seen the films . The last thing you could ever say about " Blue Sunshine " , however , is that the idea is derived from something else . Its intriguing concept is totally unique and perhaps one of the most original ones ever to feature in a low-budgeted 70's movie . The outstanding ? I even daresay brilliant ? premise of " Blue Sunshine " actually makes it all the more painful to acknowledge that the overall execution of the film is slightly disappointing and even a bit boring . The opening sequences as well as the climax are sublime , but unfortunately everything in between moves at an incredibly slow tempo and it's very difficult to stay fully focused the entire playtime . The film opens with footage of several different & seemingly unrelated people beginning to suffer from physical ailments , like terrible headaches and the severe loss of hair . Jerry Zipkin even witnesses one of his friends going completely out of his mind and killing three women . Being the prime suspect in the murder investigation , Jerry discovers that his friend experimented with a type of drugs called Blue Sunshine back in college and possible the side effects only begin to show now , more than 10 years later . Jerry confronts the former junkies , who are now respectable people with important jobs , with their past and hopes to prevent further bloodbaths this way . As said , the plot is magnificent and Lieberman manages to continuously sustain an ominous & moody atmosphere , but the entire middle section lacks panache and memorable substance . Zalman King's performance as Jerry is good but his character is overly weird and not exactly likable . His response to the murders and especially his methods of approaching the other Blue Sunshine users are strange and it's actually no wonder the police suspects him of all the crimes . Don't expect any gory situations , neither , but the hairless psychos look genuinely creepy and menacing . The soundtrack is excellently psychedelic and the sequence shot at the disco is already legendary by now . In spite of Synapse's recent transfer to DVD , the picture quality is rather inferior , which gives a good idea of how obscure this film was all these years . Although not being the masterwork I anticipated ( or hoped ) it to be , I still wouldn't hesitate to recommend " Blue Sunshine " to any other open-minded fans of eccentric 70's cinema . All the other Lieberman films I've seen thus far ( " Squirm " , " Just Before Dawn " and " Satan's Little Helper " ) are worth tracking down as well .
A violent crusade of purification	Slow , terrifically build up shock-tale that easily passes as one of Franco's finest achievements , almost on the same level as " The awful Dr . Orloff " or " Miss Muerte " . The acting is weak but the film is well-scripted and versatile enough to appeal to wide cult-audiences ? Throw in some rancid sleaze and eerie Parisian dark alleys and you've got yourself a truly undiscovered Euro-horror gem . Just make sure you watch an uncut version , preferably the one under the title " The Sadist of Notre Dame " . The premise handles about the mentally unstable ex-priest Mathis Laforgue ( played by maestro Jess Franco himself ) who recently escaped from a psychiatric clinic and now dwells the streets of Paris . He sees himself as a redeemer , sent by God to wipe out all that is impure . Laforgue kills prostitutes ; horny teenagers and erotic party-goers , claiming he's doing it to save their souls ? Call it a revival of the Inquisition , set in present day Paris ! This is a cruel film with a cruel message . Even though it all sounds quite far-fetched , the film is brought with a strange sense of realism . " The Sadist of Notre Dame " makes up in cruelty what it lacks in budget possibilities . There are quite a few sequences that contain severe acts of torture and mutilation , interfered with the most perverted sexual undertones . Franco at his best , in other words . And I was quite surprised to see his acting capabilities are above average too ! Franco , with a constant nihilistic glance in his eyes , outshines the rest of the cast . His regular actress ? Lina Romey ? was at her most ravishing during this era and she willingly shows this whenever she cans . You get the picture , this is a real must for the more demanding cult-collector .
From pitch black class to pure camp !	I'm always up for a story about that handles about demons and darkness , so I was pretty enthusiast in anticipating this " Constantine " . It's the third comic book adaptation in row that centers on a anti-hero ( after " Hellboy " and " The Punisher " ) , men that are really not too keen on the supernatural powers they developed or were born with . John Constantine is a sinister private eye , capable of whooping demon-butt back to the depths of hell . His duty is to keep an eye on " halflings " , beings that attempt to cross over the borders of heaven , hell and earth . When Constantine is approached by police woman Angela Dobson for help concerning the strange suicide case of her twin sister , they slowly discover that Satan's son is preparing his arrival on earth . Many people around this website seem to hold a grudge against Keanu Reeves but I really liked him in this role . The " you-don't-like-it-go-to-hell " attitude really suits him ! Unlike many other ' critics ' here , I really enjoyed the first hour of " Constantine " as it features a constantly ominous atmosphere , sublime black humor and even a few efficient and impressive shock moments ( the cows ! ! ) . The images of hell , or simply the use of special effects in general , is well considered and very compelling while the interactions between Reeves and fellow unearthly creatures often leads to terrific kitschy fun . Unfortunately , but almost evidently , director Lawrence can't keep up this quality-level and the film sinks deep towards the worthless camp section . The twists then become more ridiculous , the cheese factor increases and the effects become more and more flamboyant . The only real aspect to enjoy during the second hour is a glorious OTT appearance by Peter Stormare ( Fargo , 8mm ) as Lucifer . " Constantine " sure isn't the turkey many people here claim it to be , but by no means it's an essential milestone , neither .
Hammer's most gruesome production ?	The last entry in Hammer's legendary Frankenstein cycle by far isn't the best one , but it probably is the most appealing chapter to enthusiast horror buffs due to the excessive use of blood and ugly make-up effects . " Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell " is the direct successor of " Frankenstein must be destroyed " , since Jimmy Sangster's " Horror of Frankenstein " introduced a different lead-actor ( Ralph Bates ) and repeated the initial premise of the infamous baron . Terence Fisher's grand finale is set entirely in a mental asylum where good old Peter Cushing continues his deviant experiments undercover . He changed his name to Dr . Viktor and receives help from a gifted new-arrival who got convicted for committing the exact same sorcery-crimes ( although Frankenstein considers it science ) . In their private asylum-chambers , the doctors create new life using the brains and body parts of unfortunate patients of the asylum . Although good campy fun nonetheless , this film slightly disappoints compared to its predecessors . I feel like Fisher could have used the grim asylum setting much better and even Cushing's characters isn't as ' evil ' as it was in the other films . Simon Helder ? Frankenstein's partner in crime ? is entirely listless and Madeline Smith doesn't do much either , aside from looking really cute . The monster doesn't evoke feelings of fright and he actually looks more like a fugitive cast-member of the " Planet of the Apes " - series . On the other hand , you could say that this installment is one of the better since the scenery is raw and the monster is more repellent looking . There are some really nasty killings in this film and the medical experiments are extremely graphic ( a gratuitous brain-transplant , anyone ? ) . Purely talking trivia , this also is an interesting film as it was Terence Fisher's last directing achievement . This great director easily was one of the genre's most important icons , with on his repertoire most films of both the Frankenstein and Dracula franchises as well as some other milestones like " The Devil Rides Out " and " The Mummy " . His last film ( Fisher passed away in 1980 ) is great entertainment and nothing more .
Gypsies , tramps and ? DEMON WITCH CHILDREN ! !	Amando de Ossorio will probably always be my Spanish horror-hero because he made the utterly amazing " Blind Dead " - quadrology and also the even more amazing ( but sadly obscure ) " Lorelei's Grasp " . His horror films , even the less good ones , are hugely atmospheric and often manage to come across as genuinely creepy even though the subject matter is far-fetched and implausible . This theory works for " Demon Witch Child " , too . The film itself isn't impressive and certainly not very original . A young girl possessed by satanic forces that cause her to speak foreign languages and make her body to float in thin air ? Now , where have we seen that before ? Yes , this basically is the umpteenth European imitation of William Friedkin's " The Exorcist " but , please , don't allow this to spoil the fun . It's an adorably weird exploitation effort , with quite a collection of deranged characters and inexplicably compelling sub plots . In a quiet little community , a gypsy woman is suspected of kidnapping infants and commits suicide by jumping out of the police station's ( closed ) window . She avenges herself by using her witchcraft powers to possession over the eminent politician's nine-year-old daughter . In this younger body , the old witch can carelessly continue sacrificing newborn children to Satan ? Her concerned father and nanny call in the help of a young priest , but he's in the middle of being stalked by a girl who can't accept that he chose God over her . This last part describes a completely irrelevant but entertaining sub plot , by the way . Believe it or not , but the scariest thing about this movie is the young actress who plays Susan ! And not even during the sequences where the gypsy witch possesses her soul ! No offense to her , but Marián Salgado looks almost naturally uncanny and definitely NOT like an innocent schoolgirl ! The elderly actress who plays the actual witch looks pretty creepy too , but at least she was supposed to have this effect . Sadly enough , " Demon Witch Child " disappoints in the gore department . There's no exploitative bloodshed and Amando de Ossorio only hits at gruesome events , like a castration and a brutal baby killing . Perhaps the lack of budget is to blame , but that sure didn't stop our director when he made the " Blind Dead " movies . The possession-effects are nice and cheesy and the eerie music is very efficient . Personally , I have a weakness for shameless rip-offs ( I usually enjoy them even more than the real thing ) but most horror fans will likely enjoy this film , as long as they're not too demanding .
NOT the typical and silly kind of high-school slasher you expect to see !	Without having seen this movie , a righteous first impression would be that this is a vile and ordinary 80's slasher . . . only made in the mid-70's . Well , you'll be pleased to learn that this assumption is wrong ! Even though the vicious-sounding title and the short summary on the back of the VHS imply the opposite , " Massacre at Central High " actually is an intelligent and subversive portrait about a youthful generation and the giant gaps between them . Yes , in many aspects this really is an ahead-of-its-time slasher in which numbnut school kids get slaughtered in the most inventive ways , but the basic premise leans closer to the typically 70's revenge flicks and ? and this is really special ? the wholesome it forms is something entirely new and unique : an ambitious and moralistic exploitation flick . Set in a Californian high school , seemly without teachers or other staff , the new kid in town David becomes the target of a trio of bullies . These three already besiege and terrorize the rest of the school population , but with David they go so far that they eventually cripple his legs in a cowardly attack . Driven by revenge , David literally pulverizes the bullies but ? just when he thinks to have brought peace inside the school's walls ? the former nerds become the new bullies and they all wish to be in control of the schoolyard . . . I sincerely doubt whether writer / director Rene Daalder fully intended it to be like this , but his film gained a solid cult reputation because it features so many effective political metaphors ! Especially since there are absolutely no adults in sight ( no parents , police men or teachers ) , " Massacre at Central High " is like the perfect allegory on society , with its corruption and typical hypocrisy . Still , this is not a great film . . . and that's largely due to the total lack of budget and craftsmanship . The dialogues are poorly written and the acting is far below average . Although Daalder often succeeds in creating a suspenseful atmosphere , still too many parts of the movie are tedious and lead nowhere . Most of the actual killing sequences are imaginative , but they're too bloodless and the special effects are ludicrously fake ( the rock rolling off the cliff and crushing a tent ! ) . If you purchase this film because it looks so much like fun splatter flicks like " Prom Night " or " Graduation Day " , you'll feel very cheated , that's for sure . But , either way you look at it , it's a curious gem .
It's Alive ? but not lively !	During the early 90's , generally not the greatest period for horror cinema , there was a short but nevertheless noticeable revival of the genre's most classic & legendary stories . Apart from Kenneth Brannagh's modern update of the Frankenstein novella , there also was Francis Ford Coppola's interpretation of " Dracula " ( undeniably the most famous one of the bunch ) and the unsuccessful re-telling of the " Dr . Jekyll and Mr . Hyde " story in " Mary Reilly " . These modern versions benefited from superior production values and all-star casts ; yet personally I can't say I was a big supporter of the initiative . They're all fine films , no arguments there , but they somehow feel like an excuse for younger horror fans to simply neglect the ' dated ' black-and-white originals . The 1930's versions of these tales still form the standard , as far as I'm concerned , and they remain fundamental viewing if you desire to call yourself a fan of the stories . That being said , Brannagh's interpretation of Frankenstein is obviously a good and visually striking cinematic effort , but it honestly won't impress you that much if you're familiar with versions from past eras . Much more than the other aforementioned titles , it too often feels like Kenneth Brannagh intended to bring the ultimate version of " Frankenstein " and therefore it occasionally feels preposterous and overly obtrusive . Also , and in spite of some really engrossing moments ( especially during the last half hour ) , the director puts the emphasis too much on the sentimental aspects and nearly not enough on the petrifying side of the story . Quite a lot of footage is dedicated to Victor Frankenstein's private life . His role as obsessed scientist is always second to his role as concerned and romantically tormented patriarch of the Frankenstein clan and therefore Brannagh can't hold a candle to the performances of previous Victor Frankensteins like , say , Colin Clive or Peter Cushing . Even the creature as well , albeit masterfully depicted by no less than Robert De Niro , can't seem to find the right balance between frights and pity ; something that showed almost naturally in the older versions . A lot of material feels like unnecessary padding and slows down the pace whereas the essential parts of the film are not strong enough to rescue the wholesome . The settings and costumes are deeply impressive , as is the whole new make-up job on the Frankenstein monster ( Robert De Niro's mutilated face is likely to shock and repulse the more squeamish viewers amongst us ) , but the film overall fails in the department of substance . Some highly acclaimed actors are offered too little character depth to work with , like Ian Holm as Frankenstein's father and John Cleese as his reluctant mentor , and others can't bear the heavy burden that comes with the character , like Helena Bonham Carter and Kenneth Brannagh himself . I would easily recommend " Mary Shelley's Frankenstein " , but only for the terrific illustration of decors and make-up and , foremost , only after having seen the " Frankenstein " ( 1931 ) and " Bride of Frankenstein " ( 1935 )
Shark Hunters of the Caribbean : Diving for Lost Treasures	" Guardians of the Deep " could more or less be described as a rip-off of Peter Benchley's " The Deep " , only ? this version is a whole lot better and numberless times more entertaining ! It's a very silly and immensely grotesque adventure movie , with highly implausible stunts and unrealistic characters , but the whole thing is so spirited and so vividly directed by Enzo G . Casterllari that you can't help but be amused . Spaghetti western hero Franco Nero ( wearing a blond wig that nearly makes him unrecognizable ) stars as a treasure hunter on a quest to recover $10 million from a plane wreck that lies on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea . The valuable loot is located nearby a shark-infested cave , but that can't be an issue , as Mike also happens to be a fearless and ruthless shark hunter who doesn't even hesitate to crash down in the open sea with a parachute to take on a Tiger Shark with his bare hands , now how about that ? ! ? His search is complicated when other parties learn about the treasure as well , like a CIA agent on " holiday " and a bunch of corrupt local police officers . " Guardians of the Deep " features a constantly high level of spectacle & suspense and the film benefices extremely from the lusciously exotic photography by Raúl Cubero . This film is very beautiful to look at ? and to listen to , as the De Angelis brothers ' score is downright phenomenal and dreamy . Although not exactly a legit entry in the " Sharksploitation " sub genre ( like " Great White " , " Monster Shark " or " Tintorera " ) , this film contains some of the greatest and most masterfully enacted shark attack sequences ever in low-budget cult cinema ! The sharks in the cave assist Mike during the finale and explicitly devour a couple of his opponents . The action scenes are impressive at sea as well as on the mainland , with tough macho fistfights , wild car chases and shootouts . This puppy is quite obscure and difficult to find , but worth tracking down if you like tropical settings , shark-action and Castellari's versatile repertoire .
Nah Na Na Na Na Na Nah ! Thun-Der ! You've been ? . Thundercrack'd !	Referring to " Thundercrack ! " as simply being a weird cult flick would be a serious understatement and actually a direct insult , since certain people around this website already tend to call mainstream movies like " Memento " or " Pulp Fiction " weird and confusing . Weird ? Not quite ? A term to summarize " Thundercrack " in one simple word has yet to be invented . The closest we've got now is " extravagant " , " demented " and maybe also " totally fed up " . This movie can't even be categorized in one genre , as it's hardcore pornography as well as slick comedy as well as cheesy 70's horror . Let's just stick to the old cliché saying : it has to be seen to be believed ! Imagine yourself a typical low-budget horror opening , in which random people gather around an old dark mansion during a nightly thunderstorm . They're all slightly eccentric characters with unusual backgrounds and / or odd personalities and , naturally , the female owner of the mansion is the queen of all madness . Mrs . Gert Hammond ( excellent performance by Marion Eaton ) is a mentally messed up widow in a permanent state of delirium , constantly babbling to her deceased husband AND extremely addicted to peeled cucumbers . Her guests soon begin to physically experiment with themselves and each other and these sexual outbursts become gradually odder . Masturbation and ordinary hetero-sex at first , but before you properly realize it ; you're up to your neck in gay sex , voyeurism , sex with peculiar attributes and even bestiality . This may sound like devastating cult-cinema , but director Curt McDowell captures it all on film like it's the most common thing in the world and after a while you almost begin to wonder whether YOU aren't the abnormal one for not yet having experienced sexual intercourse with a horny gorilla ! " Thundercrack ! " is shot in black & white and features a handful of stylish moments , despite the trashy subject matter and the obvious lack of financial means . This movie is available in two versions , but I can safely say already that even the ' cut ' version ( 120 minutes instead of 150 ) is more than weird enough for every avid fan of offbeat cinema on this planet . Watch it , and I assure you'll never eat a cucumber again in your life !
It's amazing what you can do with no budget but lots of inspiration . . .	The following review will most certainly contain SPOILERS ! ! ! Now here's a guy who deserves a decent comeback . . . Director Frank Hennenlotter ! It's very remarkable what this guy pulled of with almost no budget . He's the living proof that you only need a dose of healthy creativity and a good basic idea to make an important movie . And Basket Case is an important one . It grew out to become one of the most controversial cult movies and it's still fun to watch . The acting is terrible . Even the main character ( I don't know him but his name sounds like he has Dutch roots ) is a very bad actor but they're all trying very hard . The creature effects are amazingly cheap and cheesy but at the same time entertaining and they make you wish Hennenlotter had more money . He spent most of his budget to fake blood so therefore the killing scenes are nasty , gore and even a bit disgusting . Just how a true cult-horror fan likes them , in other words . But like I said before , it is the story that fascinates you the most . About a boy who takes a basket case with him everywhere he goes . It contains his horrible deformed twin brother . They were Siamese Twins but " it " ( which is called Belial ) only exists of a head , claws and some other flesh . They were separated when they were young and Belial now wants to avenge that . All persons who were involved in the operation have to die . At the same time , Belial is very jealous whenever his brother makes contact with girls and he develops his own " sexual feelings " Director Frank Hennenlotter made two sequels to this one ( which I haven't seen unfortunately ) and two other very good titles . Brain Damage and Frankenhooker . Basket Case is without a doubt the best one and at the same time an important film for the genre . The idea of a Siamese Twin is just brilliant in my opinion . I would love to see what this director is capable of when he can use a bigger budget . The creativity he used here sure was promising but he seemed to have stopped filmmaking since the early 90's . Highly recommended if you ain't easily disgusted . A must see for fans of cult and milestones as well !
They don't make ' em like this anymore . Oh wait , . . . they DO !	In case you're a loyal fan of horror movies , I'm pretty sure you've already heard ( and probably even USED ) the cliché saying in this comment's subject line . We sometimes get the impression that the only horror films Hollywood serves us nowadays are uninspired slashers and colorless remakes , all staring untalented bimbos and washed up hip hop stars that urgently need to boost up their careers by playing a film role . For all these reasons ( and many more ) , James Gunn's " Slither " is an immensely joyful movie to observe , as it's a genuine homage to the cheesy , gooey and especially GORY old-school horror days ! Gunn's fluently written script catapults us straight back to the 1980's , with its typical little town setting , witty redneck characters and ? above all ? make up effects that don't rely on advanced computer techniques . The story opens when an evil alien monster crash-lands his " eggshell " in the woods and literally invades the body of local town figure Grant Grant ( Michael Rooker ) . Grant then impregnates a slutty townsgirl and she " gives birth " to thousands of eerie slugs that go on infecting the rest of the villagers . Grant's loving wife Starla teams up with the Sheriff , who's also her biggest admirer , to battle the slugs and prevent total elimination of the hunting town's population . Judging by James Gunn's age and background , he grew up during one of the golden eras of horror and this is clearly noticeable by the amount of tributes and references he put into his own film ! Little aspects and gimmicky ideas from " Basket Case " over " The Blob " onto " Tremors " all feature in " Slither " and yet never at one point the film becomes overly hectic or stupid . It doesn't contain much tension or originality , but that largely gets compensated by the imaginative splatter . Grant gradually turns into a large-sized pile of slimy smut ( similar to Brian Yuzna's " Society " ) that sucks innocent villagers into his stomach . . . or something like that . Other people get their head blown to pieces by a shotgun , or entirely eaten by the slugs and one poor sucker is even cut in half by Grant's tentacles . The dialogues are often hilarious , particularly the mayor is quite a character , and the cast members all seem very happy to be a part of this production .
The Hitchhiker's Guide to SICKO - Galaxy !	Now we FINALLY know who was driving the freaky old truck in Steven Spielberg's classic " Duel " ! It was Rutger Hauer's character John Ryder and he's still prowling the deserted American highways ? only without the truck . Young Jim Halsey picks him up to avoid falling asleep behind the wheel , but Ryder soon makes clear that his intentions are very hostile . Halsey fights back , though , and this makes him the perfect adversary for Ryder's insane and blood-soaked road games . The entire movie is one giant chase in which Ryder commits gruesome crimes and Halsey gets the blame for them . " The Hitcher " has a very simplistic script but that's probably why it's often so terrifying . The raw cat-and-mouse interactions between the nihilistic madman and the innocent kid supply the movie with genuine suspense , at least , if you don't ask too much questions regarding the unlikely powers Ryder disposes of . He seems to have to the ability to appear in several places at once and he can even butcher an entire police station without waking up Halsey who's asleep in the cell next door ! There are several more unlikely elements in the plot , but you easily look past them , simply because it's such an adrenalin-rushing and explosive thrill-ride . In fact , the real flaws only begin to show when the screenplay attempts to bring depth , more specifically by suggesting a certain connection between the two main characters . The forsaken Texan highways excellently fit the film's disturbing tone and they're beautifully filmed by John Seale . The story definitely owes a lot of its impact to Rutger Hauer's surefooted performance . He can surely give image to a malicious bastard like few other actors can . Last but not least , the film contains a couple of highly memorable shock moments , notably the truck-stop sequence and the inside the diner ( better always check twice before you put fries in your mouth ! ) . As briefly indicated before , " the Hitcher " reminded me a lot about " Duel " . Both thrillers introduce psychopaths with unclear motives , or even no motives at all , and their actions only get crueler as the movies develop . " Duel " is a better film , in my opinion , but " the Hitcher " certainly is another highly recommended thriller and still underrated even though it gained a modest cult-reputation over the years .
Yet another treat for the " Graboid " - fans !	Man , I love the Tremors-franchise like Winnie the Pooh loves his honey ! After four films and a TV-series ( which regretfully didn't got aired in my country ) , I still think these giant underground worms are the total definition of coolness ! And therefore , I really feel like this entry is made for me and homogeneous souls exclusively . If you think the original Tremors was one of the most entertaining monster comedies ever made , and you even got hooked on the sequels ? you'll certainly have a great time while watching this fourth installment . If you thought Tremors was only so-so and the sequels atrocious ? well then , you'll absolutely loath number 4 as well . Which is fine by me too but don't go bashing it then , neither . I think the Tremors-series depends on one major advantage ? Every chapter in the series is put together by more or less the same film crew . Brent Maddock and S . S . Wilson are the creative thinkers behind the idea ever since the first film . And each and every single time , they try to uphold the originality aspects and add some ingenious twists to the nature of these lovely monsters . The first three episodes , for example , describe the Graboid's entire reproduction cycle . Tremors 4 actually is a prequel and takes us back to the Wild West , Nevada 1889 . Michael Gross , the trigger-happy hero from all the previous entries stars as his own ancestor who's the owner of a Silver mine . Hiram Gummer has the exact opposite character of his great grandson at first , but you can slowly see his personality forming itself . The idea and structure of Tremors 4 is pretty risky , but I think it works and true fans will have a great time searching for the numerous references towards later adventures . Enjoy ! !
Slightly " Cleaner " Harry ?	" Dirty Harry " was a revolutionary early 70's action movie that instantly caught the attention of cinema-loving ( and hating ) audiences because of its no-nonsense attitude , excessive depiction of violence and thoroughly nihilistic atmosphere . " Magnum Force " , the first sequel in the fairly long-running series and released barely two years after the original , is still an excessively violent and nihilistic toned action movie , but unfortunately it hasn't got the same shocking and adrenalin-rushing impact as " Dirty Harry " . Partially this is normal , since the surprise element has vanished , but especially the subject matter here is far less disturbing ( also far more fictional ) and even the character of Harry Callahan seems to have softened a little already . " Magnum Force " still remains a pretty terrific and highly exciting cop thriller , of course . I never doubted that for a single moment , especially not since the screenplay was penned down by no less than John Millius ( " Big Wednesday " , " Conan the Barbarian " ) and Michael Cimino ( " The Deer Hunter " ) . The problem ? if you can even call it that ? here is that " Magnum Force " is only a prototypic action vehicle , whereas " Dirty Harry " also served as a contemporary 70's statement to assure the times were rough and flower-power influences were dead , buried and gone forever . Harry apparently picked up his badge again , after throwing it away at the end of the original , since he's still upsetting his superiors by enforcing the law with unorthodox methods . He's called back to the homicide department when the city of San Francisco seems " plagued " by a series of killings of prominent gangsters , like drug barons , mafia couriers , pimps and professional hit men . Shortly after they narrowly escaped justice and got acquitted , the criminals ' are found barbarically murdered ? Executed , even . Harry initially suspects one of his closest colleagues struggling with depression , but there are other possibilities as well , like a young and straight-shooting posse of traffic cops . " Magnum Force " is exciting , but not exactly suspenseful since director Ted Post never really intends to make the killer's identity a big mystery . The vigilante-massacres are extremely sadistic to behold and especially the irrelevant interludes ( Harry single-handedly preventing the hijacking of a plane , Harry brutally sorting out a supermarket heist ? ) are super amusing . Harry Callahan may not be as " dirty " as he was in the first film , but Clint Eastwood nevertheless still portrays him as the ultimately cool tough cop . Eastwood also receives support from Hal Holbrook as the grumpy superior and David Soul ? who'd later play Hutch in the legendary series " Starsky and Hutch " ? as the younger cop . The soundtrack is excellent and the photography and editing are far more sophisticated as in the first film . There's even a replacement , albeit less memorable , quote for " Do you feel lucky , punk ? " ; namely " A man's got to know his limitations " .
Swinging Bava !	Mario Bava himself repeatedly stated that this is the worst film he was ever involved in , so luckily enough there still are some loyal and naive fan-boys ( like myself ) to reassure the public that " 5 Dolls for an August Moon " nonetheless remains a worthy purchase and definitely better than your average horror / mystery from the early 70's . Even though this giallo can't possibly reach the brilliance-level of nearly every other Bava film ( the list is enormous , with " Black Sabbath , Kill Baby ? Kill " , " Blood and Black Lace , " Black Sunday " ? ) , it's a light-headed and often ingenious effort . The plot is a very simple variation on Agatha Christie's " Ten Little Indians " , set on an island inhabited by rich and utterly greedy bastards . The island's owner , George Stark , invited a bunch of businessmen and their wives over for a weekend of million-dollar-deals and adultery . One of the guests invented a groundbreaking formula ( something about resin ) and the others make it a sport to bid the most money for it . They aren't even ashamed to throw in their sexy wives as an extra . The party really gets interesting once the invitees ' bodies turn up brutally murdered one by one . " 5 Dolls for an August Moon " indeed looks more like a satire instead of a suspenseful giallo and it's obvious that Bava didn't put much devotion into it . The murders are mainly committed off screen but the emphasis lies on the comical storage of the cadavers , namely in a meat-locker and clumsily wrapped in plastics . The dialogs are weak yet almost the entire film is foreseen of a jazzy soundtrack , which actually makes " 5 Dolls for an August Moon " Bava's most swinging horror movie ( the über-cool " Danger : Diabolik " is falls into a class of its own ) . The totally unpredictable twist at the end is fantastic , in my opinion . The cast is more than interesting , particularly because the unearthly beautiful Edwige Fenech hops around in bikinis and lingerie most of the time . She's a good actress , but she's even a better nude model . For just this one time , don't listen to the master-director himself and watch this film ! You won't regret it , especially not if you miss the typical tastelessness of the 70's .
Faster and Far More Furious !	" Pit Stop " feels like an amalgamation between modern day racing flicks " The Fast and the Furious " and " Days of Thunder " , only this Jack Hill film is way , way ? WAY cooler , of course . Perhaps the aforementioned movies benefice from higher budgets , greater names in the cast and far more impressive ( to teenage audiences , at least ) car turning gimmicks , but both the characters and the actual racing footage in " Pit Stop " are genuinely more plausible and convincing . Regular race tracks are for pansies now , by the way , as Jack Hill introduces the Figure Eight Race Track ! As its name implies , the track is shaped like an eight with a dangerous intersection in the middle and , the more the race gradually evolves , the harder it becomes for the drivers to avoid accidents . The plot centers on big shot Grant Willard ( no less than Prof . Quatermass himself ? Brian Donlevy ? in his last film role ) who sponsors young & reckless drivers and deliberately forces up the competition and hostility between them . Willard picks up the handsome and talented Rick from a vile street race and challenges him to defeat the reigning champion and ill-tempered Hawk . The competition between the two racers mutually and between them and the ultimate racing champ Ed McLeod becomes increasingly unbearable and even continues outside the racing tracks , as the men also share a romantic interest in the same women . " Pit Stop " is possibly Jack Hill's most ambitious and intellectual accomplishment as a director to date ! Surely his more famous films like " Coffy " , " Switchblade Sisters " and " The Big Doll House " are more sensational and easier to categorize as exploitation , but this film is stylish , involving and very realistic . The Figure Eight track was for real and most of the races exist of authentic footage and actual crashes interlarded with obviously fake images of Sid Haig and Richard Davalos pulling crazy faces and grotesquely turning a steering wheel . The character drawings are extremely legit as well , since the racers are depicted as obsessive and one-track-minded daredevils and their women as caring and supportive groupies that pray every race will have a happy ending . The performances are amazing , with a very young Ellen Burstyn in one of her first film roles after a lot of TV-work and Sid Haig portraying yet another delightfully freakish character . The film does run a little long and some of the padding buggy-racing footage in the desert , albeit spectacular , could have easily been cut a little . Jack Hill was also responsible for his own great editing and Austin McKinney's black and white cinematography is terrific . Highly recommended in case you're looking for a REAL cinematic highlight , rather than to watch Vin Diesel's big shiny bald head in a hideous car or Tom Cruise pretending to know anything about NASCAR driving .
Bunch of SAVAGES ! ! !	A four-headed team clumsily ends up stuck in a jungle . Pretty soon , two of them die ( rather clumsy again ) while savage aborigines are chasing the other two males . The duo depletes one last time when one of them disappears during a wild-river flow ? does it have to be said ? clumsy ! The supposedly last cannibal tribe on earth imprisons the one man left , named Robert . They don't start cooking him just yet , but fool around with him a little , first . He escapes and takes a local girl with him , who serves the role of beautiful hostage . However , the journey through the undiscovered jungle is hard , long and full of surprises . Ruggero Deodato's general rehearsal before unleashing the notorious ' Cannibal Holocaust ' upon the world is an explicit horror film , but not as shocking or repulsive as its successor . This film merely serves as an old-fashioned adventure-movie , there were Cannibal Holocaust is a severely shocking ethical portrait . If you ignore all the illogicalness of this film , you'll have yourself a good time . That's a fact . It's a rough and straight-to-the-point horror production with more than enough footage to keep you entertained ? although a lot depends on your definition of entertainment , of course . Italian horror standards stand throughout the whole film : gore , sleaze and cruelty ! Since so many things are happening during the first 20 minutes of ' Jungle Holocaust ' , the film tends to get tedious after a while ? or so you would think ! Surprisingly enough , there still are more than enough adrenalin-filled sequences that keep you alert and ? and this really is positive in my book ? Deodato gives an excellent portrayal of how someone is unintentionally driven into complete madness and a total loss of realism . Jungle Holocaust contains quite a lot of animal cruelty , which can be regarded as offensive by Italian horror-haters . The crocodile-dissection easily equals the vicious tortoise slaughtering in ' Cannibal Holocaust ' . The cannibals themselves are some of the wickedest I ever saw and they seem to follow some bizarre rituals , too . They show an unusual interest for male nudity and they don't seem to worry too much about controversial handlings such as murdering an infant ( pretty disturbing sequence that was ) . They do bring forward beautiful women , as Me Me Lai is the sexiest native girl I ever saw . Jungle Holocaust is essential viewing for Italian horror / sleaze fans . Not as memorable as ' Holocaust ' or ' Ferox ' ? but certainly worth your time .
Go twisted sister , GO !	Why on earth are most comments on this " Killer Nun " so exaggeratedly harsh ? It's certainly true that this film differs immensely from all the other Nunsploitation-movies made previously , with a story that doesn't involve Satan-worshiping nuns for once and a remarkably lesser amount of graphic sex , but that doesn't mean it's inferior exploitation ! On the contrary , I strongly believe the story of " Killer Nun " actually works for a change , since it's loosely based on a factual Belgian serial-killer case about a mentally unstable hospital-convent nurse who turns to murder after imagining an incurable disease . Actress Anita Ekberg , who I think she resembles Kathleen Turner , plays the respected sister Gertrude but she's no longer the devoted nurse / nun she used to be . She's convinced she has cancer , gets addicted to morphine and starts to do ungodly things , like mistreating her patients and even sexually provoking men as well as her young roommate . When some patients are found dead , even Mother Superior begins to doubt sister Gertrude . " Killer Nun " is atmospheric , but often very slow and admittedly the substance might be too scant to fill a whole horror movie with . Peculiar as well is that director Giulio Berruti hints at several controversial topics ( lesbianism , masochism . . . ) but eventually evades to show anything , and this is probably the reason why so many horror fans claim " Killer Nun " is a boring and eventless film . Nevertheless , this rare Italian exploitation gem features a terrific musical score as well as a handful of gory sequences ( that were largely cut in post " video-nasties " versions ) . The acting is far above normal 70's euro-horror standards , with Ekberg , Joe Dallesandro and beauty Paola Morra all in great roles . As far as I'm concerned , this is a good and underrated film !
Is there a doctor in the hospital ?	Michael Ironside certainly wasn't the type of guy you wanted to add to your list of enemies back in the early 80's ! He spontaneously caused people's heads to explode in " Scanners " and he's an even bigger monster here in " Visiting Hours " , as he gives image to a reticent yet malevolent & misogynistic killer who can't accept that one of his target victims survives in the hospital . The victim we're referring to is Deborah Ballin ; TV-show hostess and strong activist for women's rights everywhere . Following another one of her much talked-about shows , Colt Hawker perpetrates the house and assaults her , but he doesn't finish the job properly . Then , despite of the huge police and media attention given to the case , he goes to the hospital and kills everyone who stands between him and Deborah , including nurses and unfortunate patients . " Visiting Hours " is a peculiar 80's slasher that doesn't get much appreciation from either critics or regular horror fans . Personally , I have no idea why because this movie is extremely creepy and director Jean-Claude Lord professionally spreads the suspense throughout the entire film even though we instantly know about the maniac's identity and what his motivations are . The screenplay spends quite a lot of time enlightening us about Hawker's private life and childhood traumas through brief flashback-sequences , making " Visiting Hours " some sort of crossover between John Carpenter's " Halloween " ( with a knife-wielding maniac butchering innocent people ) and no less than Martin Scorsese's " Taxi Driver " ( with the complex sociopath background of the culprit ) . This combination isn't always successful or 100 % plausible , but at least it provides a more or less original slasher setting since these flicks usually just involve high school teenagers or summer campers . J . C . Lord creates tension through eerie POV-shots and bone-chilling music ( courtesy of Jonathon Goldsmith ) and the murders are pleasingly bloody , albeit a bit mundane . " Visiting Hours " is probably one of the ONLY 80's slashers that is occasionally able to really scare you , so I'm more than willing to look past most of the flaws . And yes , there undeniably are some obvious flaws . Like some other reviewers righteously pointed out already , there's a problem with both the editing and continuity . The killer ? as well as the other characters ? seems to move from one place to another very fast . One moment he's observing a nurse in her backyard and the next he's walking around the hospital fully disguised in a doctor's coat . Also , the cops guarding the hospital aren't very useful since Hawker hasn't got the least problem of walking in and out of there without having to show identification . Finally , I'm not entirely sure what Sheila's ( Linda Purl ) profession is . Is she just a nurse covering night shifts or a fully degreed doctor ? If she's a nurse , then where are all the doctors ? Most of the film takes place inside a hospital ? duh ? yet there seem to be only two nurses working there . Then again , the acting performances are another good aspect . Ironside is excellent and genuinely petrifying as the silent psychopath and the two female leads ( Lee Grant & Linda Purl ) are very convincing in their roles of hunted preys . Oh , Captain Kirk also stars , but his character is about as useful as non-alcoholic beverages at a graduation party . " Visiting Hours " is a good horror film , check it out !
Gritty Survival horror with marvelous filming locations .	With France undoubtedly being THE best horror-producing country at the moment ( points of reference include : " Inside " , " Frontier ( s ) " , " Them " and " High Tension " ) , this brand new movie was high on my must-see priority list as soon as I noticed it was programmed at the annual Fantastic Film Festival in my home country . I was even more confident upon learning that the directors of " Humains " are the same guys responsible for the genuinely masterful make-up art in the aforementioned " Inside " . This is the debut feature of the duo Jacques-Olivier Molon and Pierre-Olivier Thevenin , and they opted for a gritty survival horror concept with solemn anthropological undertones and a consecutively bitter ambiance . The plot is too absurd to label the film as an instant classic and it takes slightly too long before the pace properly picks up , but " Humains " is nevertheless a professionally made and highly compelling shock-adventure with truly stupendous filming locations and a fantastic , unremittingly barbaric last half hour that will cause you to leave the theater speechless and in a moderate state of shock ! Professor Schneider and his two closest assistants travel to a remote Alps valley region in Switzerland for an essential anthropology expedition , as they found strong evidence about the origin of the human race that could actually alter all existing evolution theories as we know them . Shortly after their arrival , and after picking up a stranded and constantly bickering family of three , their minivan dramatically crashes down a mountain . The survivors are first subjected to a devastating showdown with nature itself before facing a rough and deadly confrontation with the greatest anthropological discovery in history . The cinematography is stunning the suspense gradually builds up towards a few very intense climaxes , but the major plot twist halfway the film is just too implausible . Also , I'm afraid we've seen a bit too many variants on survival & backwoods horror lately and the large variety of inbred freaks , hillbillies and mutant families simply aren't that menacing anymore . Not even in this case , where we're dealing with bona fide and unhinged cavemen . Still , the acting performances are stellar ( Dominique Pinon is brilliant again ) and the make-up effects are obviously grandiose , with a handful of stomach-churning death sequences that are jaw-dropping cruel . " Humains " is definitely recommended to experienced fans of grim survival horror and even to admirers of National Geographic Channel ; as long as they fast-forward the sickening parts .
Deadly Hammer mind-games on the Riviera !	Multiple reviews , and even the BBC announcement voice-over , are stating that " Taste of Fear " is arguably one of the greatest films Hammer Studios ever brought forward . This is quite a challenging enunciation , as Hammer were responsible for an incredibly long list of genre classics , varying from old-fashioned monster films to thought-provoking Sci-Fi movies and psychological thrillers . " Taste of Fear " definitely belongs in the last category , but personally I wouldn't say it's their absolute best film . The quality and execution of Jimmy Sangster's screenplay is on par with their similar films " Nightmare " , " Paranoiac " and " Hysteria " , but since " Taste of Fear " came out a handful of years before those titles , I suppose it's entitled to a little bit of extra admiration . But still , the concepts of all these films are derivative of the French masterpiece " Les Diaboliques " , so we can only really praise Hammer for imaginatively imitating the original milestone at least four times . " Taste of Fear " is an atmosphere-driven and convoluted black & white chiller , but the direction of Sangster's script is slightly too predictable and it waits only until the climax before surprising the viewer with a couple of truly awesome and unexpected twists . The wheelchair bound Penny Appleby travels to her parental house in the French Riviera , supposedly at the request of her father but he isn't even there to welcome her when she arrives . According to her exaggeratedly friendly stepmother and the housing staff , her father is away on a business trip , but Penny soon begins to spot his lifeless body at several places on the estate . There are never any witnesses and the local doctor as well as the stepmother thinks she's hallucinating . With the help of the charming chauffeur Bob , Penny assumes that her father is really dead , and that it is the stepmother's plan to drive her insane and subsequently claim the inheritance . But before they can go to the police , she'll first have to proof that her father got murdered . Seth Holt masterfully builds up a brooding suspense and ominous atmosphere , but the pacing is a little too slow and the film lacks a few efficient shock elements to keep you attentive . However , there are some creepy images to enjoy , most notably the times when Penny spots her father's corpse around the house . The last 10 minutes are downright brilliant and definitely compensate for the rather tame middle section . Douglas Slocombe's camera-work is utterly stylish and surely contributes to the film's macabre atmosphere . Even though Christoper Lee always remains a truly reliable performer , the French accent isn't his strongest point .
Dead in the Water . . . ( um , in a GOOD way ! )	Despite being slightly ( just slightly ) disappointed by this third offering , I simply can't bring myself to rate any of the Blind Dead films any lower than . Call me biased if you must , but these are eyeless Templar zombies we're talking about here ! It's only the greatest , most inventive euro-exploitation idea of all times and writer / director Amando de Ossorio never fails in delivering a couple of atmospheric and downright spine-chilling scares . " Ghost Ships of the Blind Dead " has an entirely new setting that immensely appeals to me . The feelings of claustrophobia which automatically come with this setting somewhat makes up for the most powerful sequences of the previous two installments which are missing here , namely when the Templar Knights were slow-motion galloping on their undead horses . You guessed it by the title ; here in part three the Templars bob up and down international waters on a mysterious 16th century galleon . Two young fashion models , floating around the ocean unprotected for the sake of a publicity stunt , report the existence of the eerie galleon before vanishing of the face of the planet . A limited rescue expedition is sent after them , only to encounter an alternate fog bank dimension where the blind dead walk the deck of their ship at night and guard a legendary treasure . Compared to the first two films , " Ghost Ships ? " starts off rather slow and it nearly takes half a film before we get to see our beloved sinister skeletons and hear their obligatory Gothic music . For some reason , probably budget-related , this second sequel is also a lot " softer " , as most of the killings take place off-screen and not one of the female cast members takes her clothes off ! Nonetheless and as stated above , this film is overall very suspenseful and contains several beautifully horrific images . The climax sequence here is also a vast improvement over the one in " Return of the Blind Dead " and definitely raises your expectations for yet another fun sequel . And maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of this series , but I definitely think that this entry in particular was very influential to future horror classics . The terrific scene near the end in which the Templar zombies emerge from the sea was imitated by Ken Wiederhorn in " Shock Waves " and the glorious use of ominous , inescapable fog was optimized by John Carpenter in , duh , " The Fog " .
Bad Girls Go To Hell ?	Purely by coincidence , I watched two movies in one day ( presumably the only two ever made ) that are attempting to link criminal tendencies with genetics . Both " The Bad Seed " and " Twisted Nerve " ( the other one ) controversially suggest there's a direct connection between the protagonists ' deviant murders and their mental inheritances . The main difference , however , is that the latter film is a provocative , mildly sleazy and in-your-face shocker whereas " The Bad Seed " is a very stylish , eloquent and sophisticated period piece that moodily builds up its suspense towards an remotely uncomfortable climax . Personally I always cherished a huge devotion for ( horror ) movies dealing with murderous children . Considering the time of release and the obvious lack of explicit bloodshed , it may not be my favorite ' evil child ' movie , but it's undeniably a pioneer in genre and thus a hugely important trend setter for later horror movies . Cherubic 8-year-old Rhoda Penmark is the seemingly ideal daughter : polite , intelligent , helpful and well-mannered . Her mother Christine slowly starts to notice , however , that Rhoda reacts extremely fanatic and relentless to certain things , like for example the spelling contest at school where she missed out on winning the medal by a narrow margin . But when the boy who did win the contest then mysteriously drowns during a school's picnic in the park and Rhoda is the one who was last seen with him , Christine has real reasons to get concerned . She gradually witnesses the dark side of Rhoda's character and righteously begins to wonder if her behavior could be linked to her own awful childhood memories . Probably the year 1956 was still a bit too soon for such a disturbing central premise , but what a shock-impact it must have made ! The script is adapted from a stage play by Maxwell Anderson ( which must have been even more shocking to behold ) and that's admittedly the biggest problem I have with " The Bad Seed " . There where other reviewers around here surefooted claim the film doesn't at all suffer from the typical stage-restrictions , I think it does . It's a slightly overlong film with a minimum of sets and art-decoration . And even though practically all the performances are marvelous and unforgettable , the film is exaggeratedly talkative and some characters ' monologues - like , say , those of the incredibly overactive landlady Monica ? should have been a little more succinct . The entire final act is simultaneously brilliant and tacky . The " first " climax , where you actually expect the film to end ( or , as in my case , hope the film would end ) is staggering and efficiently shocking . The " second " and ultimate climax , on the other hand , may look tremendously spectacular but it's thoroughly unconvincing and doesn't at all fit the tone of the film . The end sequences are just clear evidence that Hollywood had to follow a strict set of rules regarding morality and that the right punishment overcomes those who commit crimes .
HEADS off to see the wizard . . . the nauseating Wizard of Gore !	Another sensationally over-the-top splatter party directed by everyone's favorite horror lunatic ; THE Hershell Gordon Lewis ! " The Wizard of Gore " might not be his ' best ' film , but it's definitely a fun experience and actually one of Lewis ' most ambitiously plotted films , since he toys with subjects like hypnotism and optical illusions . None of the magical tricks are properly explained , as Lewis ' sneakily avoids that in the dumb finale , but at least he tried to do something extra and ingenious with this film . Ray Sager , some sort of crossover between Vincent Price and porn actor Harry Reems , plays Montag The Magnificent ; a self-acclaimed illusionist genius who butchers girls from the audience live on stage but has them return to their seats again in one piece . A young reporter , who's always dragged along by his girlfriend to see Montag's shows , discovers that the girls turn up dead after all and their corpses are damaged exactly like they appeared to be on stage . It's rather curious how you never grow tired of the way Lewis displays the gore in his movies ! The sequences here in which female bodies are disemboweled , impaled or even crushed with an industrial punch press are overlong , monotonous and completely implausible , yet you stare at the screen with a gigantic smile on your face . Of course , these are the only significant scenes in " The Wizard of Gore " as the rest of the film hangs together by lousy acting , embarrassing dialogues and a shortage of decors . By the year 1970 and after having unleashed a handful of similar horror movies already , Lewis still couldn't care less about building up tension or continuity and went straight for exploitative grossness . The least you can say is that his work is an acquired taste , but he shall be forever worshiped by drive-in fanatics and other sick puppies , like myself . Amen , Mr . Lewis ?
The Army of Angels is all here . . . But where's God when you need him ?	" The Prophecy " is one of the better and undoubtedly one of the most ambitiously plotted horror movies of the 1990's . In a decade where most horror movies were mere uninspired imitations and / or sequels in franchises that already outstayed their welcome , writer / director Gregory Widen ( co-creator of the original " Highlander " ) comes up with a uniquely original and complex religious thriller dealing with fallen angels , the Second War in heaven , soul-sucking , angel autopsies and former priests turned cop slowly regaining the lost faith . The atmosphere of the film is pitch black and sinister and , even though there are copious opportunities to revert to a " simple " occult horror movie with a lot of gory killings and nasty images , Widen always makes sure the emphasis remains on coherent storytelling and characterizations . When inspector Thomas Daggett is called to the morgue to look at a super-human corpse , little does he know he's about to become involved in the greatest spiritual showdown in history . The Second War of Heaven has moved down to earth , with the ultra-malignant ( but über-cool ) fallen archangel Gabriel hunting down the evil soul of a deceased war criminal . If he takes possession of this soul , Gabriel is destined to win the battle upstairs , so the " good " angel Simon tries to prevent this by hiding the soul elsewhere . The plot , albeit obviously very fantastic and far-fetched , is intriguing and there are enough twists to keep you alert at all times . The character drawings are detailed and very well done , as you feel like you know enough about the evil characters as well as the good ones . Most amusing aspects about " The Prophecy " , however , are the really ingenious parts / gimmicks of the screenplay that aren't even that essential to the main story lines . For example , Gabriel requires a human assistant to drive him around and stuff , and for this job he uses suicide victims that are about to step into the light . This often leads to very funny situations . Another highlight is the appearance of no one less than Lucifer himself near the end of the movie . You see , there are a whole lot of angels ? good or bad ? present here ; the only party guest missing is God himself . The cast is overall splendid with terrific roles for Elias Koteas , Virginia Madsen , Eric Stoltz , Adam Goldberg and Viggo Mortensen . The absolute star of the entire " Prophecy " franchise , and especially this first and superior installment in particular , naturally is Christopher Walken . He's stupendous as Gabriel and continuously balances between blackly comical and genuinely petrifying . Walken is probably one of the only actors who can make you laugh and shiver with fear at the same time . Some of his one-liners here are simply priceless . Example ; when someone condemns him to hell , he arrogantly replies with " It's heaven ? The least you could do is getting the zip-code right " . Followed by two inferior sequels also starring Christopher Walken and two more that I haven't bothered to see yet .
Checkmate !	Before I even properly read what exactly the story of " Headspace " was about , I already knew damn sure that I wanted to see it , simply because it assembles one of the most impressive B-movie casts of the last 15 years ! Even though they all just appear in supportive roles , " Headspace " managed to snare legendary names such as Olivia Hussy ( who still looks yummy even though well passed 50 , I may add ? ) , Udo Kier , Dee Wallace-Stone , Mark Margolis , Sean Young and William Atherton ! With names like that , who needs extra motivations to buy a ticket ? Now that I've seen the movie during a festival screening , I regretfully can't claim that it's a genuine masterpiece but nonetheless it's a truly creative and intelligent production that definitely has more trumps than just an attractive cast . Young director Andrew Van den Houten dedicated an equal amount of energy to telling a good story AND supplying the film with exhilarating gore ! We're introduced to Alex Borden , a confused young man who carries some severe childhood traumas around with him . Every morning when he wakes up , Alex discovers that his intellect and storage capacity has remarkably increased but ; even though this sounds fantastic , he begins to suffer from terrible headaches and nightmarish visions about demons . When people in his surrounding start to get brutally slaughtered , Alex ( righteously ? ) fears that he might be the murderer without fully realizing it . The ideas and sub plots of " Headspace " are so many-sided that the film might have worked even better as a mini-series ! Now some of the potentially very interesting story lines ( like Alex ' family background or the dubious intentions of his doctors ) look slightly underdeveloped even though I'm sure they were initially meant to get processed more carefully . But hey , I'm really not complaining since this probably resulted in more action and gore ! " Headspace " contains some very effective shock-moments and graphic make up effects that will surely appeal to all horror fans ! The set pieces and locations are convincing , with a very nice portrayal of typical New York City suburbs and street life . The camera-work and choreography is terrific , at times even downright artistic , and the screenplay even manages to be educational ! How many horror movies can honestly say that teach you interesting facts about the game of chess ? Recommended !
Terrific Gothic horror ! Actually phobia-evoking ! !	Being a huge admirer of the legendary Vincent Price , I ( and I'm sure many Price fans with me ) constantly had to suppress prejudices on Ray Milland's acting performance . Not that he's a bad actor or anything ; it's just that Vincent portrayed the protagonist in the other 6 entries of Corman's Poe cycle and you can't help wondering that he would play certain sequences a lot better and more " Poe-like " . That being said , " The Premature Burial " still definitely is a marvelous and warmly recommended horror film with a haunting Gothic atmosphere and a handful of ultra-macabre sequences . The screenplay suffers a little from its own ingenious and titular gimmick , though ? The story handles about a man living with the incontrollable fear of being buried alive , so you can bet your bottom dollar on the fact that this will happen as a matter-of-course , no matter how waterproof his precautions are . Luckily enough , Roger Corman has directors-talent in abundance so he easily sails around the predictability of the story by focusing on the uncanny set pieces and morbid atmosphere . Overwhelming the viewer with typically Gothic aspects ( thunderstorms , fog-enshrouded cemeteries , eerie vaults ? ) Corman actually camouflages that several of the sub-plots are poorly ( or even not at all ) elaborated . Like , for example , the grave-robbing business or the whole murder-conspiracy near the end . Notably sardonic ( and downright brilliant ) is the sequence in which Milland shows his wife and best friend around the tomb he designed himself , complete with numerous escape-routes in case his worst nightmare should come true . Great stuff !
There's always room for one more . . . MANIAC !	The almighty Hershell Gordon-Lewis already promised us through a very catchy song that the South was going to rise again . . . and it did ! Slightly more than forty years after the Godfather of Gore's terrific splatter-classic , energetic director Tim Sullivan gathered quite an impressive cast and updated Lewis ' screenplay with new gory sickness and nowadays sleaze ' n swearing ! I'm usually not this enthusiastic when it comes to remakes of classic horror films , but " 2001 Maniacs " simply is a fun & unpretentious little movie that clearly intended to please horror fans first , rather than to hit big at the box office . The original story is preserved , as a whole bunch of young party animals on their way to the Southern beaches are detoured the peculiar little town of Pleasant Valley where they're given a warm reception as honoree guests to a local jubilee . The townsfolk , with one-eyed mayor Buckman in charge , all soon turn out to be deranged killers that are still very rancorous about the Southern Civil War casualties and , one by one , the Yankee tourists are butchered in very imaginative ways . Some of the killings are strangely similar to the ones in Lewis ' original , some of them are completely new . . . but they ALL are utterly grotesque and exhilaratingly gross ! Whenever there isn't any gore on display , we're treated to absurd dialogues , morbid jokes and ? oh yeah ? loads of naked flesh supplied by the most ravishing babes of nowadays horror flicks . Of course , purely talking cinema , this isn't much of good film because it totally lacks tension and it's tasteless , offensive and completely ridiculous . Personally I couldn't care less about this because A ) you pretty much know what to expect here and B ) it's a splendid throwback to the rancid 60's and 70's ; the times when horror cinema didn't necessarily had to justify its exploitative tendencies . Robert Englund clearly hasn't had this much fun portraying a mad character than since the original " Nightmare on Elm Street " and Lin Shaye once again proves she's a sadly underrated but great actress that delivers no matter how silly her lines are . The younger cast members perform adequately and Sullivan's directing is fairly surefooted as well . Although the additional maniac in the title never really gets introduced , I suppose it relates to the little silent girl who dissects rats for fun . " 2001 Maniacs " is one of the most entertaining horror films of the past couple of years and I recommend it highly !
French Kiss . . . . The Extreme Kind !	The French seemingly can't be beat when it comes to visceral , savage and in-your-face sadistic survival / torture porn flicks lately . Since " High Tension " skyrocketed the popularity of the horror genre in 2003 , this nation already delivered a couple of ultimately brutal movies that ? without the slightest form of exaggeration ? make U . S . films " Saw " and " Hostel " look like soft and sentimental Disney cartoons . The more or less simultaneously released " à l'intérieur " ( a . k . a . Inside ) thus far remains the absolute highlight of shocking controversy , but this " Frontière ( s ) surely ain't no Saturday afternoon picnic , neither . The rudimentary concept is a variation on the infamous mid-70's sub genre of ' Rednecksploitation ' . These films revolved on maniacal hillbillies terrorizing and butchering big city folks in rural areas far away from the civilized world and usually strictly for their own sheer entertainment . Considering the high population density all across the European continent , it would be pretty ridiculous to introduce unworldly rednecks and so Xavier Gens ' script cleverly replaces them with extremist cartels . There are several of those around here , including fanatic minions of Hitler's Nazi principles . The city of Paris is in complete chaos following the announcement of the election results , and a bunch of young thugs grabs this opportunity to commit a bank robbery and flee towards the French-Luxembourgian border . They arrive in a place far worse than the Parisian suburbs when checking into a hotel run by a deeply deranged family of Nazis . The family , led by an elderly patriarch who easily could have been one of Hitler's closest drinking buddies , need the girl for breeding reasons and subject the men to various games of sickening torture . Admittedly " Frontière ( s ) " sounds like a compilation of gratuitous gore and perverted characters , but writer / director Xavier Gens definitely had some more admirable ambitions . Extreme right-wing political parties unstoppably march forward in pretty much each European country ( in fact , their victory triggered the whole chain of events here ) , and Gens actually attempts to illustrate ? albeit quite vigorously ? what the consequences would be if they regain power one day . Anyway , you obviously shouldn't watch this movie for its valuable morality lesson , but rather because it vividly depicts hardcore violence and uncompromising cruelty . Unless you have nerves of steel and a properly insulated stomach , you might want to consider turning your head away from the screen most of the time . There's a truly nauseating massacre involving a mechanical band saw , various close range shotgun killings , slit throats , stabbed chest and one excruciatingly uncomfortable moment featuring pliers and someone's Achilles tendon . Yikes ! Vile , revolting and totally unnecessary ? Perhaps ? but definitely fascinating to behold . " Frontière ( s ) " suffers a bit from messy cinematography and limited imagery , but at the same time you could claim this also increases the primitive and savage atmosphere Gens intended to reflect . The film is definitely a bit too long for its own good ( 110 minutes of running time for a sickie film ? ) and some of the redundant sub plots and character drawings during the first half hour could easily have been cut . The make-up effects are simply great and Xavier Gens ' surefooted directing skills already bought him a one-way ticket to a promising career in Hollywood .
Awesome , awesome , awesome !	" Blazing Magnum " often gets too easily categorized as a spaghetti imitation of " Dirty Harry " , its first sequel " Magnum Force " and " The French Connection " ( groundbreaking hardcore American action movies of the early 70's ) , but this slick and unforgettable Italian exploitation product has SO much more to offer . Director Alberto De Martino , clever marketer that he was back then , does indeed cash in on the popular tough cop-thriller trend , but simultaneously his film also contains authentic Giallo story lines , which was another contemporary favored exploitation sub genre at the time . The versatility of the script is illustrated through particularly two of the numerous titles for the film . " A Special Magnum for Tony Saitta " is an archetypal " Poliziottesco " title and " Strange Shadows in an Empty Room " is a prototypic Giallo title . Both of them titles are very irrelevant , by the way , as there's nothing even remotely special about Tony Saitta's Magnum and the shadows in an empty room only refer to a minuscule sequence near the end of the film , but admittedly they sound terrific . Unorthodox Canadian copper Tony Saitti is too busy blasting bank robbers to pieces one day , and so he misses a phone call from his sister who sounded clearly upset . Later that same night , the girl ? who's at least 30 years younger than Saitti for some reason ? dies from poisoning during a party at her university . Tony Saitti now takes his time to devotedly investigate the case , along with his reliable colleague Sgt . Matthews . He discovers that his sister was having an affair with the prominent Dr . Tracer and holds him responsible for the murder , but the case soon proves to be more convoluted and including jewelry theft and a community of local transvestites . The story of " Blazing Magnum " could be told in barely half an hour or so , but the exciting and adrenalin-paced action interludes make the film so indescribably entertaining ! Of course nobody wants to cooperate with Tony Saitti's investigation , thus all his attempts to question suspects or witnesses result in extended bare-knuckle fights and incredibly flamboyant chase sequences ; either by car or on foot . It's almost hilarious to witness Tony apprehend a suspect after a 10 minute chase and having beat half of the poor guy's teeth out , only for it to end with him asking : " Have you ever seen the necklace in this photograph before ? " Especially the car chase sequence deserves to be legendary , in my humble opinion . It truly feels as if Alberto De Martino and his camera crew opened a big picture book with descriptions of all possible car stunts imaginable and then simply re-enacted them one by one ! Other irresistible exploitative highlights include Tony's bitter fight with a clique of transvestites and a tough confrontation in the little boy's room . There's a lovely amount of sleaze and several scenes in the film are delightfully tasteless , like for example the killer threatening to slice up a newborn baby at the hospital . The filming locations are adequate , the soundtrack is quite exhilarating and De Martino could also depend on a stellar cast . Stuart Whitman is a decent enough Clint Eastwood clone , but I particularly fancied seeing John Saxon and Martin Landau starring together in this Italian-Canadian co-production . Tisa Farrow plays a poor defenseless blind girl , just like her more famous sister Mia did in " See No Evil " a couple years earlier . Talk about exploitation and clever marketing !
Black Leather , Black Leather ? Smash ! Smash ! Smash !	Of all the Hammer films I've seen so far , and they are quite numerous , " These Are The Damned " definitely ranks as their strangest and most curious effort . This legendary British production studio specialized in straightforward monster movies and gorier updates of classic horror tales , but this particular film is something entirely different and actually quite hard to categorize . There are two principal ? and extremely opposite ? story lines in this film and , even though they seem impossible to blend , director Joseph Losey pulls it off without much effort . The first half ( approximately ) of the story is more or less reminiscent to such films as " West Side Story " and " Seven Brides for Seven Brothers " , and ? NO , I'm not kidding . Set on a small and isolated British island community , we're introduced to King ( the phenomenal Oliver Reed ) , his oppressed sister Joan and their docile gang of youthful thugs . The gang targets tourists , like the unfortunate American boat owner Simon Wells . Joan seduces and lures Simon to a quiet alley , where King and C° are waiting to rob and attack him whilst whistling a really awesome tune ( " Black Leather , Black Leather ? Smash ! Smash ! Smash ! ) . But Joan is fed up with her life-style and dominant brother and returns to Simon the next day , hoping to escape together . As you're subsequently expecting the rest of the story to revolve on an exciting chase & battle between the two parties , the tone and atmosphere of the film suddenly changes completely and turns into an awkward Sci-Fi ploy ! Fleeing from King , Joan and Simon end up in a cave where a bunch of children are apparently kept prisoners by the military and the government . There's something odd about these kids as they all share birthdays , feel extremely cold and respond mysteriously to Geiger counters ? The sudden change in atmosphere is unusual , but very original and fascinating ! The second half of the story is clearly influenced by the success of " Village of the Damned " , which happens to be one of my favorite Sci-Fi tales and easily of the greatest classics in the genre . A fairly high level of suspense is sustained throughout both story lines and there are several genuinely creepy moments to enjoy . The acting performances aren't superb , but Losey's direction is surefooted enough to compensate . The stylish black & white photography adds tension to the already grim atmosphere and ? as said ? the theme song is truly terrific . I read about " These are the Damned " before , but it's an obscure and hard-to-find film . So , thank you very much good people of the BBC , for programming this beauty !
Lynch on the road to hell	The most creative and controversial director in cinema is back with a road-movie ! Wild at Heart is one rough roller coaster ride and a typical Lynch-cocktail of violence , sex and of course ? bizarre characters . I challenge you to find one personality in this film that could be referred to as a ? normal human being ' . As usually , Lynch introduces a bunch of wicked individuals in his film who're all messed up in the head pretty bad . Yet , I feel like Wild at Heart might be Lynch's most accessible film ( outside The Elephant Man and The Straight Story ) . The structure remains chronological and quite easy to follow . Unlike the previous Blue Velvet , I feel like the plot and development of Wild at Heart is a bit inferior to the wonderful photography . The greatest aspects in the screenplay are in fact the delicious side-chapters that are told without absolute necessity . Like the story about Lula's cousin Dell ( Crispin Glover ) , the torture of Harry Dean Stanton's character and the nasty and disturbing images of a car accident the protagonists come across . These are the little sequences that truly prove Lynch's talent as a storyteller . Overall and simply put : this movie is COOL ! It's a joy to watch and you really hate to love some of the offensive characters . Willem Dafoe takes the cake as Bobby Peru . His portrayal is a neat follow-up to Blue Velvet's Frank Booth . Peru is a filthy and despicable pervert with itchy-trigger-fingers ! It's a damn shame he hasn't got any more screen time . Wild at Heart surely isn't the greatest masterpiece out there , but you should love it for what it is : an absurd and entertaining adventure with a couple of thought-provoking values and an extraordinary love-lesson .
Not your ordinary high school slasher . . .	whei ! whei ! whei ! . . . that's about all I've learnt so far by reading the reviews on Wrong Turn . Don't get me wrong , not only here at IMDb but also the external reviews from people who are supposed to be " Professional " movie critics . Give this movie a break ! It isn't nearly as awful as everyone says it is . It actually is good considering it's a nu-horror film in the post Scream era . Most insults towards this movie are about the fact it's a ripoff from ultimate classics like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Deliverance and The Hills have Eyes . . . So ? As far as I'm concerned , Wrong Turn never tried to be unique and original . The director clearly wanted to make an enjoyable movie and maybe even a sort of tribute to the previous mentioned titles . Nothing more nothing less ! I mean , come on people , this movie even refers to the classics . In my opinion , this means they're not ashamed to admit where they searched their inspiration . Wrong Turn does exactly what it has to do . Scare the viewers at the times they don't see it coming . And pretty good , too ! I have to admit I was rather negative minded in the beginning as well . I hate the horror movies made after the ( also horrible ) scream trilogy . It's all the same isn't it . A " mysterious " killer , mostly in a stupid outfit , goes after good looking teenagers in high school and slashes them . Same story here , except the psychopaths are in fact inbreed cannibals . You don't know anything about them . . . they only make yummy noises and that they make Jason Vorhees look like Mr . Universe . The music is good and the sound effects leave very less to the imagination . If you see this film with a good dolby surround sound system , you'll have the impression the axes swing by your own ears . All this make this film 90 min of pure entertainment . One last praising word towards leading actress Eliza Dushku . . . She sure can act and I hope she once will be a great actress respected by everyone . She's amazingly beautiful and she doesn't have to show much of her gorgeous body to be sexy . Oh , and a special word of thanks to the director and crew for not letting romantic crap ( like a final love scene before the hunted get killed for example ) spoil the atmosphere of the movie . So , without any shame what so ever , I give this movie a rating .
Spaghetti-gore de luxe !	Ah , the early 80's ? Lucio Fulci's golden years in the horror business ! Within a short period of only a couple of years , Fulci created films that gave him the status of being supposedly the goriest filmmaker ever . And the true fans will agree with me that Fulci is a lot more than just gory and nauseating images ! Films like ' The Beyond ' , ' City of the Living Dead ' and ' The New York Ripper ' are filled with shocking creativity and mind-bending , original cruelty . Unfortunately , House by the Cemetery isn't really a part of Fulci's greatest work . With this film , he falls into repetitive ideas and he shamelessly adds all the typical ? haunted houses'-clichés . The premise isn't exactly brand new and handles about a middle-class family that moves into an abandoned , sinister house . The initial tenant still lurks in the basement and uses the new inhabitants to keep his rotten flesh alive ? Dr . Freudstein , as Fulci baptized him , is one of the most repulsive cinema villains ever and his killing methods are vomit-inducing , to say the least . As usual , Lucio serves close-up butchering , including heads that are cut off by blunt knives and throats that are ripped open by fingernails . I regret to say it , but I've rarely seen such an incoherent film . House by the Cemetery looks like a cheap excuse to show more gore and guts ? without a story or theme this time . It merely looks like Fulci's answer to successful films such as ? The Changeling ' and ' The Shining ' with a typical , disgusting twist near the end . Terrific material for a night of distaste or something , but not representative for the Italian shock cinema . Of course , I don't want to sound like I hate it completely since I'm still a diehard Lucio Fulci-admirer . There are bits and pieces of suspense to detect , some characters ( like Ann , the babysitter ) are really fascinating and most slaughtering is terrifically shot ( like the ' knife-in-the-back-of-the-head ' sequence ) . Catriona MacColl fills up the screen with beauty again , so all together ? I have absolutely nothing to complain ! It may be strictly for pulp cultists and Fulci-freaks , but I sure as hell am one !
Goodnight Saigon . . . Farewell Moral Values	Never heard about " Off Limits " before when it aired on late Friday night television here in my country , but everything about it instantly appealed to me big time . There's the obscurity status for starters ( I'm particularly intrigued by films I never heard about before ) , the prominent cast ( Willem Dafoe , Gregory Hines , Fred Ward , Keith David , Scott Glenn ) , the period of release ( late 80's ) and - most of all - the concept in its entirety . As you can derive from the alternate title " Saigon " , the film is set in Vietnam during the infamous war , but it's definitely not just another epic illustrating the horrible battles in the jungle or the traumatizing impact on its soldiers . " Off Limits " is first and foremost a genuine cop thriller , set in a hellish environment torn apart through warfare , and an effectively disturbing portrait of the horrible issues caused by American soldiers outside of the battlefields . McGriff and Perkins have the worst jobs in the world , since they're employed as army police officers in Saigon and responsible to investigate the crimes committed by American soldiers . One day they're assigned to investigate the murder of a Vietnamese prostitute who had a child with an American soldier . They quickly discover this isn't the first gruesome crime of its kind , as no less than seven similar cases were reported during the past year and they're clearly the work of a serial killer with a strict modus operandi . The devoted and headstrong duo also discovers that the previous officer prematurely quit his investigation even though he came fairly close to capturing the killer , undoubtedly because several high ranked officers got involved and his own life became endangered . McGriff and Perkins , however , are determined to stop to sadist killer , especially when they receive help from a beautiful and street-wise young novice . " Off Limits " is a fast-paced , suspense and frequently very violent thriller with a screenplay that is full of misleading twists , false leads and red herrings , like a legitimate and compelling whodunit thriller ought to be . Some sequences are even downright fantastic , for instance the helicopter-interrogation ( Scott Glenn is sublime ) or the nail-biting scene where the copper duo is surrounded by a mob of furious and vengeful Vietnamese people . Christopher Crowe's direction is tight and consequently surefooted ? which is quite remarkable for a debut feature ? and his own script is almost completely devoid of dreadful clichés and irritating stereotypes . I do emphasize the word ' almost ' because a Vietnam movie without mad-raving American officers and / or foul-mouthed Vietnamese prostitutes is practically unthinkable . Dafoe and Hines provide some terrific on screen chemistry , but they certainly aren't your typical witty interracial buddies like Eddie Murphy & Nick Nolte in " 48 Hours " or Mel Gibson & Danny Glover in " Lethal Weapon " . They tease and provoke each other all the time , but the atmosphere of the film and the nature of the events are simply to austere to mix with comedy . The film is beautifully shot and has a marvelous soundtrack filled with timeless contemporary songs from James Brown , Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin and Arthur Resnick . " Off Limits " is a terrific and incomprehensibly overlooked film . If you have the opportunity to watch it , please do so without hesitation .
Neighbors ? Everybody needs good neighbors ! !	I have very high expectations for all four episodes in Dario Argento's TV-suspense series called " Door into Darkness " , and the first installment certainly delivered already ! " The Neighbor " , directed by Argento's good friend Luigi Cozzi ( " Contamination " ) , is a good old-fashioned and suspenseful chiller that'll keep any fan of story-driven horror on the edge of his / her seats for a full hour . Clearly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's " Rear Window " ? as Cozzi also confirms during a brief prologue ? " The Neighbor " has a rudimentary script and introduces very few characters . A young couple and their newborn son move into a seaside apartment and spend their first night in a dark living room since without electricity . They notice a rapidly growing water stain on the ceiling and as they try to confront the upper neighbor with this , they eerily discover a dead woman's body in the bathtub . Completely isolated and petrified , Luca and Stefania entrench themselves in their dark apartment , but naturally the murderous neighbor wants to dispose himself of the two unwelcome witnesses . Dario Argento is world-famous and generally worshiped for his excessive use of gory make-up effects and explicit shocks , but the thrills in " The Neighbor " are merely suggestive and bloodless . Partly , of course , because this series was made for television distribution , but the tone of this short film also doesn't fit gross situations . Cozzi successfully puts the emphasis on slow-brooding tension and identifiable characters . Even the villain isn't the typical kind of mad-raving , axe-wielding maniac , but clearly an emotionally tormented and desperate man who got pushed over a certain mental edge . The atmosphere hence becomes much more intense and plausible , and you honestly hope for the innocent young couple and their baby to make it out of there alive . The screenplay isn't entirely without flaw , however , and contains several improbabilities . For example , why would anyone move into a new apartment in the middle of the night and it certainly isn't likely to watch movies on a small and portable TV ( working on batteries ! ) during your first evening in a totally new living environment . Still , if you simply ignore these minor flaws , you'll experience an effectively unsettling and compelling thriller . The acting performances are top-notch as well . Especially Laura Belli ( " Almost Human " , " The Nun of Monza " ) leaves a great impression as the lovely young wife . " The Neighbor " is highly recommended to avid Italian cult collectors and even to less fanatic admirers of good suspense-cinema . Personally I can't wait to watch the second episode in this series , which is called " The Tram " and was director by master Argento himself .
From zero to hero in 72 miles	It's truly incomprehensible how some rubbishy movies are so popular and easily available whilst , at the same time , there still are such wonderful gems out there that sadly remain obscure and undiscovered . I doubt many people have ever heard of " Death Run " ( a . k . a " Courage " and " Raw Courage " ) . I hadn't heard about it either , before an even bigger movie-buff than myself recommended it to me . It's a damn shame that this film is so underrated because it's a terrifically tense and action-packed 80's thriller with great acting performances as well as a solid screenplay and a unique setting . " Death Run " is more or less Ronny Cox ' one-man-project . This shamefully neglected B-movie star co-wrote , produced and starred as one the lead characters , and he did a tremendously fine job in all three areas . Three generations of ambitious runners decide to run through the desert area for charity . Pete Canfield ( Cox ) is the elderly guy who never was quite satisfied with what he accomplished in life , Craig ( Tim Maier ) is the young lad who's constantly put under pressure by his dominant father and middle-aged Roger ( Art Hindle ) is the potent friend who endless supports and consults the other two . Deep into the desert , the trio encounters a bunch of crazed wannabe-military vigilantes from Denver ( led by the sneering M . Emmet Walsh , who's once again in great shape ) . When their dangerous " training exercises " go awry and result into a fatal accident , the protagonists literally have to run for their lives , as the vigilantes won't allow them to reach the end of the desert alive . And since it's incredibly hard to outrun maniacs on motorcycles , they may even have to put up a fight . " Death Run " is drama , satire , action , and revenge-exploitation all in one . The premise is simple but effective and especially the villains are menacingly realistic . Crazed and trigger-happy vigilantes form a much bigger threat than , say , giant desert worms or space invaders and hence the suspense is much more genuine . The script makes full use of the inescapable desert location , with all its natural death traps and hideout places . There are some unexpected surprises and effective shocks to experience in this movie and the sober musical guidance is excellent . Personally , I think the ending could have been a little better , but generally speaking " Death Run " is an awesome film and here's to hoping a fancy DVD-release will follow soon . Recommended , for sure .
Great freakshow ! !	Larry Cohen's low-budget gem still remains one of the most outrageous cult treasures from the early seventies . " It's Alive " is original , amusing and surprisingly suspenseful despite of its unlikely and absurd premise . The elaboration of the idea might be a little weak to make this pass for a controversial and / or criticizing parody , still several blackly humorous sequences manage to make you think ? and worry ! So , pregnant women better beware ! Cohen exclusively gives subtle hints on what the cause may be and merely focuses on the terror of a hideously deformed infant that goes on a killing spree straight from the womb . Our director also has a professional eye for the social isolation of the parents by the media , the merciless battue of the police and the hypocrite medical tycoons attempting to keep the possible causes secret . Meanwhile , a subtle subplot about the mother unconditionally loving her breed ? no matter how hideous or evil ? magnificently develops itself through all the other action-packed story lines . This aspect alone proves Larry Cohen's talent as a filmmaker and scriptwriter if you ask me ! Tension is efficiently created through a chilling score and an imaginative cinematography ( those sewer sequences ! ! ) but the fans of blood and gore aren't ignored , neither . The multiple and highly aggressive attacks of the newborn ( it feels so weird to write this ) are very nasty and blood-soaked . " It's Alive " is an indestructible horror favorite and an absolute must for cult-lovers . Larry Cohen still is a vastly underrated cult master whose entire repertoire receives my highest possible recommendation . Both sequels to this film are worth checking out as well as his " Q : The Winged Serpent " , " Black Caesar " and " The Stuff " . Cohen also was responsible for the screenplays of semi-classics such as " Maniac Cop " , " Hell up in Harlem " and the more recent " Phone Booth " . Personally , I'm still desperately trying to find a decent copy of his " God Told Me To " .
Court-horror !	Ironically enough , " The Excorcism of Emily Rose " got released in my country ( Belgium ) synchronously with another similar , real-life lawsuit . A self-acclaimed exorcist has to justify the death of a young girl after performing inhuman rituals and fatal exorcism tricks . It's weird having seen this movie and then follow the lawsuit on TV and in newspapers . It's so easy to deny the existence of demonic possession and to brush aside exorcism as quackery , but then ? as this film shows ? you're also questioning people's beliefs and family values . Emily Rose is the sympathetic daughter of a poor but deeply religious rural family . Shortly after her long-anticipated start at the university , her body becomes the host of no less than 6 different demons . The priest of the little town where she lives , father Moore , is doing everything he can to purify Emily's body but the demons are too strong and she doesn't survive the exorcism . What makes this film different than the obvious 70's classic " The Exorcist " ( which also entirely revolves on the possession of an innocent girl ) is that the story takes place after the actual exorcism and in the courtroom where father Moore is on trial for negligent homicide . His ambitious lawyer Erin Bruner goes straight for the acquittal of her client , but father Moore only cares for telling Emily's story , despite the fact that this can cost him his career as a priest . The screenplay of this film was based on a true story and director Scott Derrickson does a great job in making the extended courtroom sequences interesting and compelling . The flashbacks , showing Emily's horrible decrepit , are very atmospheric and contain multiple shock-moments . The acting is sublime , with a powerful Tom Wilkinson as the devoted priest and an enchanting Jennifer Carpenter as the poor Emily Rose . This is not a full-blooded horror film , but definitely one of the most unsettling , disturbing and thought-provoking dramas of the last few years . Highly recommended !
Enter the horror Hall of Fame . . .	Warning : Some things written directly below this can be seen as SPOILERS ! ! ! The Omen is a great movie about the best and scariest possible topic ever . This movie really proves that horror is the most powerful genre in cinema . . . it contains the creepiest thriller moments and a good amount of touching drama . A horror role model and one of the better efforts in the genre ever . Made in 1976 , The Omen had several groundbreaking aspects and it still stands after more than 25 years . Like its even more famous " predecessor " ( sort of ) , The Exorcist uses the Christian Religion as a basic plot . If you add a few sensitive side aspects to that like child death , armageddon and politics I assure you'll be pinned to your screen for a good 110 minutes . Gregory Peck , although normally not a routine horror actor , gives away a terrific performance as Robert Thorn . He's an American ambassador who can't manage to tell his wife ( a good Lee Remick ) that their son died while giving birth . He accepts to adopt an orphan that was born on the same day and he decides never to tell his wife . When the boy - Damien - turns five , he's going through some . . . euh . . . changes ! It seems that Damien is the unmitigated Antichrist . The son of Satan himself , sent to the earth on 6am on the 6th day of the 6th month , to take over the world and to annihilate every quoin of the Christian belief . When it comes to atmosphere and tension , The Omen satisfies the most critic horror fan . The story develops itself like a sort of mystery that needs to be revealed . It's filled with surprises since you get the idea that nobody is safe in The Omen . . . You fear that every character can die at every moment and that fascinates you so much . . . The film isn't very bloody but that certainly doesn't bother you . The tension of it overrules the most beautiful gory scenes . And I have to mention the great use of music . I admit I am a sucker for loud , biblical and opera-like sounding music but I can't believe that someone is left cold with this music . The score leads in some of the most breath-taking scenes I've ever seen . Overall , The Omen is a must see and not strictly for horror fans . The whole myth about the Antichrist and his birthmark - IF it is a myth of course . . . - is one of the best stories ever written . Favorite " rewind " - scenes : If can't decide between these two so I'll add them both to this review . . . The first one is at Damien's birthday party . The party gets brutally interrupted by the nanny . She's standing on the roof and what follows is one of the most surprising and unexpected scenes of terror ever seen . Second one . . . Allow me to tell you that The Omen contains the greatest decapitation scene EVER ! ! ! You'll know it when you see it !
Oh ! The Water Out There is Frightful ! !	Hmm . . . I usually attempt to include some witty lines or jokes in my user comments , but I'm a little reluctant this time , as there's really nothing even remotely comical about the events in " Open Water " . Inspired by a saddening true story , this ultra low-budget production depicts the strange disappearance of a married couple in the Carrebean area . Fleeing from their stressful jobs , Susan & Daniel spend a vacation near the coast and decide to join a group of divers in open water . Due to a rather banal counting error , the boat leaves before the couple climbed back aboard and they're left behind in the relentless ocean . As the long hours slowly pass , Susan & Daniel are surrounded by sharks and other curious sea-creatures , but they also have starvation , exhaustion and personal arguments to worry about . " Open Water " is a seriously intense drama ( definitely no horror ! ) that confronts its viewers with some of the deepest fears imaginable : complete isolation , hopelessness , slow & painful death and being completely powerless again indestructible enemies . On more than just one occasion you'll be thankful that it isn't you drifting out there on those endless waters , and that's one of the most effective sentiments a movie can possibly evoke . This film is scary and unsettling on an entirely different level . The slowness of the script and the monotonous use of sound & camera is necessary in order to re-create the atmosphere of the tragic incident that overcame Tom and Eileen Lonergan . So , all the disappointed reviewers around here who wrongfully claim that " Open Water " is a boring and unendurably tame movie should have watched the 3rd sequel to " Shark Attack " or the umpteenth imitation of " Jaws " , as no human beings are mangled by a shark's teeth on screen . No fancy special effects or blood red-colored waters in this powerful piece of film-making ; just suspenseful atmosphere and devoted cast and crew-members . Highly recommended .
It's the season to be sadist . . . fallalalla lala la la !	Considering the time it was released , this ' Black Christmas ' must be regarded as slightly more important than your average slasher in which gorgeous sorority babes are being exterminated . Black Christmas is a trendsetter , opening the gates for Michael Myerses and Jason Vorheeses who'll only be popular several years later . The plot is as simple as it ever was ? but here , it's new and even rather courageous ! Lovely looking girls harassed by obscene phone calls and stalked by a familiar killer . Imaginatively timed around the holiday-season when the university babes are in a party mood and packing to spend Christmas with their families . Producer-director Bob Clark ( who regretfully continued his career with horny adolescent crap like ' Porky's ' ) uses many horror-clichés for the first time here : dumb cops , scream-queens , the isolated location of a fraternity house and the different stereotype-categories of female students . And ? most of all ? Black Christmas contains an old-fashioned scariness , still efficient even by today's horror standards . Finally , there still is room for comical undertones and good acting . The eminent John Saxon , but also the beautiful looking Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder ( Lois Lane ! ! ! ) Horror fans can't afford themselves to skip this one . Black Christmas is a modest milestone in the field of scary cinema .
High-Caliber cult !	Neneh Cherry already specifically stated in a song that this is a woman's world , so who are we to argue with that ? Women RULE this world , whether they carry around . 45 caliber guns or not ? Infamous cult movie director Abel Ferrara's interpretation of feminism revolves on a mute and seemly defenseless young beauty that wipes male scum from the face of the earth with a pistol . After being the victim of assault and attempted rape TWICE in one afternoon , Thana kills her second assailant and chops up his corpse in the bathtub . Whilst getting rid of the bagged body parts , she randomly kills numerous other men on the trash-filled streets of New York . " Ms . 45 " has quite a lot in common with Ferrara's breakthrough film " the Driller Killer " , except that it doesn't contain so many tedious moments and that you actually have sympathy for the Thana character , whereas Reno Miller could die instantly for all I cared . Strictly talking from a cinematic point of view , " Ms . 45 " is a much better film than " Driller Killer " as well . Ferrara manages to retain his depressing yet realistic portrait of dead-end New York , but the camera-work is much more steady and versatile . Zoë Lund , who remarkably looks like Nastassja Kinski , is a terrific anti-heroine and the fact she plays a mute even increases the complexity of her character . Lund later co-wrote " Bad Lieutenant " before sadly passing away at the young age of 37 , due to heart failure . Unfortunately , however , " Ms . 45 " didn't stand the test of time very well . The graphic violence and definitely the controversy has been surpassed severely nowadays and I sincerely doubt that the new Playstation-generation will be impressed by Ferrara's take on the explicit revenge-flick trend . Luckily selected group of film buffs including myself still consider this to be a quintessential cult gem that'll live on forever . Kill ' em all , Thana !
Garbage Can takes the trash out !	The opening sequence already demonstrates that director Umberto Lenzi disposes of a playful and curious sense of humor . When the film starts , you're most likely to grab the DVD-box again to reassure you're watching the right movie , as it opens with a typical Spaghetti Western scene showing a gang of Cowboys riding on their horses and invading a little village . Is this a Western ? The pictures and the synopsis displayed on the DVD-box surely don't look or sound like this would be a Western , but you never know with director Umberto Lenzi and lead star Tomas Milian , right ? The doubtfulness vanishes right away after the credits , and " Free Hand for the Tough Cop " naturally is a crime-thriller ( or " Poliziotteschi " , if you wish ) , but the misleading intro nevertheless proves that Lenzi is an extremely gifted filmmaker who immediately captures your full attention and interest . " Free Hand for the Tough Cop " is another wildly exiting , gritty and remarkably plotted 70's Euro-Cult cinema highlight , with a structure that is delightfully convoluted , wicked dialogs & action situations that rank amongst Italy's finest ! Personally , I would even state this film is as good as on par with the quality levels of Lenzi's most famous crime-thrillers , like " Almost Human " and " Violent Naples " , but it's not as easily available as those two and therefore still a little under-appreciated . With the revival of European cult cinema lately , this film is destined to be released in a fancy DVD-edition any time soon , and I'm sure it'll get many new fans from that moment on . For those who can't wait for an English and / or internationally released version ; the film is already available on a French label called Neo Publishing . The picture quality and sound are awesome , and the disc contains some fascinating extras , but you have to able to understand either the French or the Italian language . The indescribably charismatic and talented Tomas Milian stars as a witty criminal Sergio Marazzi , but he's widely known by his friends and enemies under the nickname " Garbage Can " . He's knocked unconscious and taken OUT of prison by the unorthodox detective Sarti , who requires Marazzi's criminal skills and experience to help his police investigation . The odd couple has to rescue a kidnapped young girl from the claws of Italy's most feared crime boss Brescianelli , and urgently , because the girl suffers from severe kidney problems and risks to die without regular medicine injections . Garbage Can manages to recruit three more wanted thugs and they begin their search for Brescianelli . Slight problem though , the crime lord recently underwent plastic surgery and nobody knows what his new face looks like . " Free Hand For the Tough Cop " actually contains LESS virulent shoot-outs and wild car chases than you'd expect , but their lack is widely compensated by wickedly intelligent dialogs and a continuously anarchistic atmosphere . Every single character that walks through the screen is genuinely fascinating and provided with a compelling background . Unlike Lenzi's other Poliziotteschi flicks , this movie isn't really set in the busy and crowded center of one of Italy's most prominent cities , but most of the action takes place in rural villages and deserted industrial factory buildings . Tomas Milian and Henry Silva are both brilliant in roles that are the opposite of their previous collaboration with Umberto Lenzi , namely " Almost Human " . And if you're slightly familiar with Italian cult cinema , you'll definitely also recognize many other actors and actresses that ( briefly ) appear in this production , like Luciano Rossi , Claudio Cassinelli and Biagio Pelligra . The climax is excellent and very violent , the music is catchy and both the camera-work & editing are handled with a great deal of professionalism . This certainly isn't just another smutty and repulsive Lenzi quickie , but a solid and unforgettable Lenzi highlight !
Great , great , GREAT ! Hooray for rancid exploitation !	Paul Naschy , star of an innumerable amount of Spanish exploitation classics ( including the " Hombre-Lobo " cycle ) returns in this wondrously bizarre and imaginative film that premiered at the International Festival of Fantasy Films . I'm pretty convinced that " Rojo Sangre " won't be very successful and that's a damn shame because it finally is a truly odd and eccentric Spanish horror effort again , and the fans have seen far too few of these recently . The premise is a variant on the legendary " Faust " tale but , as much as every other aspect in this film , it's a very VERY demented take on Goethe's classic story . Naschy shines as the veteran actor-in-low-water Pablo Thevenet . He despises the young generation of actors and actresses for being untalented and he's frustrated about the fact that new and arrogant casting directors don't know him . Desperate for work , he accepts a job as a living sculpture in a fancy brothel ran by extravagant people . But something seems to have snapped in Pablo's head and he starts a violent killing spree , focusing on those who were responsible for artistic downfall . The plot really gets complex when Pablo's employers turn out to be unworldly and ultimately messed up . The story doesn't make much sense half of the time ( and the other half is downright confusing ) but still you love what you see because it's so vivid and nostalgic . You fancy yourself back into the glorious days of euro-exploitation and that's a feeling I personally missed enormously . " Rojo Sangre " features a lot of old-fashioned sleaze , good music and adorably insane characters ( a transsexual business lady or a millionaire snuff-fanatic , anyone ? ? ) . The dialogues are exceptionally well-written and the cinematography is astonishingly beautiful ! It actually doesn't look leak a cheap exploitation film at all , as the camera-work is ingenious and the visuals are very creative . The gore and make-up effects aren't as outrageous as I expected ( or hoped ! ) them to be , but there certainly are a couple of marvelous gruesomeness-highlights , including nasty images of a cut up corpse , multiple stabbings and professionally slit throats ! Despite the devastating material , the screenplay also makes room for genuine black comedy and a couple of very comical anecdotes . The film opens with one , when Pablo gives a detailed description of his bizarre sexual fetish ! That sequence is hilarious and you already consider " Blood Red " a success before it even properly begun ! Paul Naschy is brilliant as Pablo Thevenet ( it might even be his best performance ever ) and maybe that's because he really feels related to his character's situation . No worries Paul , I can assure you that the godly Paul Naschy is still worshiped by a limited group of cult-lovers ! Watch " Blood Red " when you've got the chance !
Welcome on the road to Hell ! ! This is Araki's world	The opening credits claim this is a ' heterosexual ' movie by Gregg Araki ? Now that statement is still open for discussion . Something that isn't open of discussion is the fact Araki created one of the meanest , most good-looking pieces of trash of the 90's ! Imagine yourself a lesser-hyped version of ' Natural Born Killers ' and exclude that last bit of political correctness . It seems like Araki was testing how far he could go ? and then cheerfully exaggerated some more . The Doom Generation is a speed-driven and absurd road movie against all forms of good taste . A young couple , accompanied by a trigger-happy madman , faces the most eccentric situations and deal with the most extravagant characters . The film contains a lot of violence but even more absurd and demoralizing humor , so the whole thing never really becomes disturbing or provocative . Lots of naughty language and nudity , though ! Rose McGowan's character Amy is the closest thing to a cult / trash queen we saw in the 90's and her naked body is always a joy to behold . James Duvall ( sort of like Araki's lead in his entire teenage-alienation trilogy ) is terrific as the confused teenager with the ' whatever ' attitude ! Gregg Araki's visions are downright brilliant from time to time . Many people don't seem to think so ( just check the other comments around here ) but his film is extremely stylish and a perfect portrayal of a pop culture generation . Heck , even his colorful slang ? which includes a whole dictionary of genitalia synonyms ? alone is worth the effort . The Doom Generation is one the most special films of the past decade and it really deserves the cult-followings it developed over the years . Check it out if you're open-minded , not quickly offended and not faint of heart !
Bad Girls , You Are Beautiful !	" Switchblade Sisters " is one of the most awesome and amusingly incompetent trash / gangsploitation movies ever made ; only back in the period when it got released nobody ever intended to make a bad film , of course . Personally , I enjoyed the privilege of seeing this film in a genuine grindhouse theater and with no less than writer / director Jack Hill present there to introduce the film and answer questions from the audience . Hill explained how he always dreamed of filming his very own version of Shakespeare's " Othello " , yet this story was probably the closest he ever came to realizing that project . Irrelevant info , I know , but this just to illustrate " Switchblade Sisters " once actually was a remotely ambitious film and not just a piece of lesbian trash . The recent revival of drive-in & grindhouse cinema ( courtesy of Quentin Tarantino , who's also a giant fan of this particular film ) enlarges the sleaze-elements and silliness of 70's movies even more , but you should always at least try and see it in its framework of time . That being said , " Switchblade Sisters " is first and foremost a delightfully absurd gang-wars movie and a thoroughly flamboyant portrait of female empowerment . This baby has it all ! Stereotypical gang members that easily look over 30 but still attend high-school , big fat ugly lesbian prison wardens , romantic rivalry , jealousy , treason , roller-skating shootouts , secretly desired rape sequences and ? last but not least ? female Maoist guerrilla fighters . Maggie is the ravishing and potent new chick on the block and she eagerly joins Lace's Dagger Debs gang after proving herself in a knifing contest . The Debs are the girlfriends of the Silver Daggers and all together they hang out in a ramshackle hangar to play pool and sell dope . There's a gang war with the Crabs in the offing and jealous Dagger Deb Patch inflicts a dispute between best friends Maggie & Lace when she notices they both fancy the same hunk . If you can overlook ( and you simply must when you're interested in this type of cinema ) the sometimes atrocious performances , one-dimensional characters and the absolute lack of logic & coherence , you will find great enjoyment here ! The clichéd situations inside the penitentiary ( with the obese lesbian warden ) , out in the schoolyard ( with the nervous principal ) and in the skating hall ( random M-16 gunfire ! ) are all sublime . The whole finale , from the actual virulent street war up until the main Jezebels ' showdown contest , is simultaneously suspenseful , spirited and even a bit touching . The soundtrack is great , although clearly not as enchanting as the ones featuring in Jack Hill's ultimate Blaxploitation masterworks " Coffy " and " Foxy Brown " . Speaking of which , this movie perhaps lacks the powerful and attention-demanding presence of a starlet like Pam Grier , but the girls here are still more than adequate . The supportive characters are actually more convincing than the main ones . Lace , played by Robbie Lee , is an often intolerable and whiny child and Maggie simply appears too cherubic to play a rough chick . I vote for Patch to be the Jezebel's unhinged leader ! She's unreliable , deceitful , mean and stark raving mad . Awesome film , highly recommended to slavering sick puppies like myself .
America is a utopia ! Milwaukee doesn't even exist ! !	" The Clonus Horror " quickly developed a cult and underdog reputation because there's an ongoing lawsuit between the makers of this low-budget Sci-Fi gem and Dreamworks / Michael Bay , who " stole " the concept for their massively budgeted film " The Island " . Personally I haven't seen " The Island " , too mainstream for my taste , but I can easily understand why Bay & C° had interest in the premise . It's close to brilliant , disturbing and ? considering the year of release ? impressively ahead of its time . Clonus is the name of secret and secluded location where young , handsome and sportive clones are carefully " nurtured " until their wealthy owners ( mostly politicians and industrialists ) need them for an organ transplant . Of course , the clones themselves don't know what they are and what purpose they'll eventually serve . They're led to believe that one day , when they train and study hard , they can go to America and live a life of luxury . One of the clones named Richard falls in love on the premises , skeptically begins to discover the truth about his existence and escapes into freedom . But , even though he encounters some friendly and understanding people in the outside world , Richard soon experiences that the he can't escape the fiendish Clonus conspiracy . This is another one of them films for which I can't possibly comprehend the negative reviews , hatred and low ratings . Did Michael Bay perhaps hire people to rate " The Clonus Horror " on IMDb ? Because I can't explain the miserable 3 . 30 rating otherwise . The tension and atmosphere are professionally built up , the make-up effects are admirably engrossing ( especially considering the budget ) , there are few neat and efficiently shocking twists near the end and the acting performances are fairly solid , with even some remarkable cameos of veteran stars like Keenan Wynn and Peter Graves . Terrific and criminally underrated film , I hope it soon gets the recognition and praise it deserves .
The bloody and inhumanly cruel hunt for witchery !	Bloody hell ! ! ! I tell you , I'm used to seeing rough and cruel horror films but I assure you this one is really hard to watch at times ! You can either take that as a recommendation or as a warning ! Mark of the Devil portrays the rites of witchfinding near Austria / Germany in the 17th century . Honorable men who're satisfying their own bloody and perverted lusts by killing young women in the name of God Himself . This film shows a lot of resemblance to the British classic starring Vincent Price ? The Witchfinder General ? only it's a lot more explicit and raw ? in other words : a lot more ' exploitation'-like ! Mark of the Devil contains multiple sequences in which girls are severely tortured , mutilated and eventually killed ! It may be disgusting at times , but it's a very realistic portrayal of the absurdity and horror that actually took place once . The arrogance and naiveté of the Catholic Church is terrifically presented through the performances of Herbert Lom ( Lord Cumberland ) and Reggie Nalder ( Albino ) who still their appetite for terror by abusing God's name . Potential viewers who're interested in medieval torture-techniques will have the time of their lives while watching this film ! The whip plays a leading role in this film , along with other bizarre methods such as burnings , the ripping of tongues and fingernails , stretching people ? and a truly horrific ritual that involves freezing cold drops of water . The scenery and used locations are magnificent and the guiding music is absolutely brilliant . Mark of the Devil really belongs to the greatest films ever made in the category of European ? nasty ' exploitation . The film can even count on a solid cast including a very young Udo Kier ! Here , he is at the very beginning of a rich career that is still growing to be more impressive . It's a thrill to see a film featuring this living Cult-cinema legend at young and promising age . Udo Kier plays Herbert Lom's pupil , a very devoted witchfinder-to-be ? . devoted that is , until he falls head over heals in love with a beauty who's accused of witchery ! Mark of the Devil also stars a couple of ravishing girls ( you'll learn that presumed witches are a damn good-looking species ) that definitely live up to the Hammer beauties around that same time . Whatever you do ? don't let the bad reviews scare you off ! Mark of the Devil isn't nearly as bad as they say ? Just because some people can't handle a share amount of graphic violence doesn't mean the film is awful .
Fantastic 80's gem , scandalously and inexplicably forgotten over the years !	What we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise , a cast that is filled with familiar faces AND one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films . So . . . could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated ? ? ? " Prison " is the Finnish director Harlin's American debut , which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like " Die Hard 2 " , " Cliffhanger " and " Deep Blue Sea " . The story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle Wyoming prison , re-opened for the cause of over-population in other , more modern state penitentiaries . Inside the former execution dungeons , the restless spirit of the electric chair's last victim still dwells around . The now promoted warden Eaton Sharpe ( Lane Smith ) was there already 40 years ago , when this innocent man was put to death , and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial . It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived . Viggo Mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and Chelsea Field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past . " Prison " contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the unbearably tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain ! Unlike any other horror picture from that decade , " Prison " features an amazing sense of realism ! By this , I refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls , of course , and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed . . . even though these are genuinely unsettling as well . The film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror . The absolute best terror-moment ( providing me with nightmares ever since I saw it at rather young age ) focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire . Haunting ! ! The screenplay only suffers one flaw , but that's a common one . . . almost inevitable , I guess : clichés ! The story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding . We've got the ugly , fat pervert with his ' cute ' boy-toy , the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and ? naturally ? the old ' n wise black con who serves a lifetime ( did I hear anybody yell the name Morgan Freeman ? ) Don't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise , as there are so many other elements to admire . The photography is dark and moist , the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class B-actors are excellent ( the fans will recognize Tom Everett , Tom ' Tiny ' Lister and even immortal horror icon Kane Hodder ) . Forget about Wes Craven's god-awful attempt " Shocker " or the downright pathetic cheese-flick " the Chair " . This is the only prison chiller worth tracking down ! Especially considering Viggo Mortensen peaking popularity nowadays ( I heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves , Hobbits and other fairy creatures . . . ) this true 80's horror gem oughts to get an urgent DVD-release !
Dark , gritty , raw and very VERY disturbing !	It's remarkable and quite praiseworthy how writers and directors continue to make great movies out of one of the oldest and most ( over ) used story lines in cinema ! " Dog Bite Dog " is basically not much more than just the simple story of an lone copper obsessively chasing a brilliant criminal , only Pou-Soi Cheang distinguishes his film from the rest by being extremely violent & relentless . This is unquestionably one of the grittiest and most uncompromising movies I've ever seen , with an atmosphere of constant nihilism and characters that seem to come walking straight out of hell ! Not even the installments in Chan-Wook Park's trilogy of vengeance ( with the exception of " Oldboy " , perhaps ) or any other infamous Cat-III film ever released were as sadistic and brutal as some of the events depicted in " Dog Bite Dog " . Pang is a young and ruthless Cambodian assassin who lands in the crowded streets of Hong Kong to eliminate the wife of an eminent judge in a restaurant . When the police arrives at the place , young officer Wai sees how Pang hastily flees from the scene of the crime and follow him . The first actual confrontation between the two rabid dogs results in a gigantic blood bath , as Pang mercilessly kills several hostages and even Wai's long time friend and colleague . From then on begins a thrilling and action-packed cat and mouse game between the frustrated cop and the professional killer . The latter also saves a young girl from the constant sexual abuse of her father and stays with her at her shed in the local garbage dump . What makes this routine action / thriller so fascinating ( apart from the explicit violence ) are the main characters ' backgrounds ! Pang , the hit-man , is a Cambodian orphan and has been trained to fight & kill for money ever since he was a child . He knows no restrictions , has no mercy and barely speaks a word . Wai , the cop , became particularly ruthless and unorthodox ever since his role-model father ( also a cop ) lies in a coma after a drug-related incident . Lai doesn't question suspects and witnesses ; he yells at them and he's prepared to sacrifice everything in order to stop his brand new nemesis . People with a weak stomach or tangled nerves are advised to stay away from this film , because the cruelty and shocks featuring in " Dog Bite Dog " can easily cause nausea . It's not the type of violence where bloodied heads and chopped off limbs fly through the air , but more like the intense and utterly disturbing type where people attempt to crush their opponents mentally as well as physically . The filming locations are effectively dark and eerie and the extremely sober music makes the already harrowing tone of the movie even more petrifying . The performances are terrific ! I wouldn't be surprised if Edison Chen and Sam Lee treated each other like enemies on the film set as well , because their on screen hatred and disgust feels a little too legitimate . " Dog Bite Dog " is a powerful and unforgettable film , highly recommended if you can stomach it . If you fear you can't , just wait a few years for the inevitable American remake which will unquestionably soften the premise a little .
Satan Likes ' em Wayward . . . and Jailbait !	I was part of an extremely fortunate bunch of people who got to see this rare gem of euro-cult cinema on the big screen ; moreover inside an authentic old-fashioned grindhouse type of theater where the walls threaten to fall down at any given moment and the equipment has surely seen better days already . I can assure you these rather primitive viewing conditions add a large portion of raw atmosphere to an already gritty and unsettling film . But nevertheless " Don't Deliver Us From Evil " suffers a little from its own controversial reputation , as it has got a lot more to offer than just graphic shocks and gratuitous nudity . The film poster proudly announces , in letters that are far bigger than the title itself , that this is the only French film to be banned in France . It's a nice promotion stunt , but it only forces potential viewers to anticipate a non-stop sleazy and exploitative smut flick , whereas Joël Séria's film is primarily a beautifully dark and almost poetic depiction of how adolescents of high social descent deal with boredom and sexual curiosity . The script may be loosely inspired by the real-life Parker-Hulme murder case ( the same case Peter Jackson used for his " Heavenly Creatures " ) but I strongly believe Séria also used the opportunity to criticize the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church as well as the unfair French social classification system . During the long & boring nights at the boarding school , 14-year-old Anne becomes interested in salacious literature and she quickly convinces her friend Lore to join her into exploring the exact opposite of all the Catholic mumbo-jumbo that is forced upon them by the nuns and their deeply religious parents . It all starts with naughty , yet harmless games and the discovery of their own bodies & sexuality , but the situation escalates into something genuinely malice . When summer vacation begins , and the girls spend two months away from authority , they perform a ritual to become accepted as disciples of Satan and cross the line for good . Their innocent games are gradually replaced with the the dangerous seduction of mentally unstable men , vicious rites of animal cruelty , arson and eventually murder . Séria's criticism towards the Catholic Church and the authorities ' obnoxiousness is mainly illustrated through the lack of response by the adults ! The film exclusively revolves on the acts of the two girls and never at one point suggests that the grown-ups in their surrounding are even aware of the evil they commit . Anne and Lore actually even bring themselves down in the ( downright staggering and jaw-dropping ) finale because they THINK they'll get caught . The performances of Jeanne Goupil and Catherine Wagener are simply amazing and also very courageous . It's almost unbelievable to accept they 19-20 years old during filming as they honestly look like inexperienced girls who barely hit puberty . Their age and especially the nude sequences they're in often make " Don't Deliver Us From Evil " a terribly difficult film to watch . It feels incredibly wrong to watch at these girls as they're parading in their panties and provocatively seduce men , but it more or less remains a tasteful film at all times . The impact of the message Séria brings probably was a lot more shocking in the prudish France of the early 1970's ? which is undoubtedly why the Church insisted on censorship ? but it's still intense enough to upset audiences even today , and particularly the end-sequence will haunt your thoughts for several days afterwards . It's a beautiful film , with enchanting cinematography by Marcel Combes and an excellent ' La La La ' theme song that regularly gets repeated during the most essential sequences .
Is it possible to improve on perfection ? ?	When I first saw Frankenstein ( 1931 ) , I was amazed . It was one of the greatest stories I ever saw and it impressed me on so many levels . I honestly didn't think I would ever see such a great phenomenon again . Well , I should reconsider that . The sequel is even more magical , more impressive and more perfect . The bride of Frankenstein can easily be considered as the best horror movie ever made and it even ranks high it the list of best movies in general ever made . The atmosphere , the locations , the acting and direction . . . really nothing at all can be criticized . Compared to what everybody thought , both the Monster and Dr . Frankenstein survived the incident at the windmill at the end of the original Frankenstein . While the Monster flees to freedom , Dr . Frankenstein is approached by Dr . Pretorius . A wicked scientist who created life himself , but he needs the genius of Dr . Frankenstein to complete his project . Although he swore to his girl Elizabeth he would stop playing God , Frankenstein is intrigued by the the project of Dr . Pretorius and joins his research . Meanwhile , the Monster is feeling terrible . He realizes he scares everybody away and only found friendship with a blind man . During this absolutely beautiful and magical scene he learns to talk and express his emotions . When he's hunted down again he meets Dr . Pretorius and demands him to make him a friend . Because of this , Dr . Pretorius can force Frankenstein to create life again . If he doesn't , Elizabeth shall die . . . This movie gives a completely other meaning to the word " sequel " . When this word is heard , people usually think about an inferior product which was made to make more money . This certainly isn't the case for The Bride of Frankenstein . Hard to believe , but this movie , in fact , ADDS a lot of great things to the saga of Frankenstein . It handles even more about the human emotions and contains some very important lessons . We also see a lot more about the personalities of the characters . The Monster of course , but also Dr . Frankenstein and his girl . And a few great new characters are introduced . The blind man to begin with . . . An adorable man who is as lonely as the creature . He doesn't judge on what he sees ( well , he can't of course ) and searches for deeper feelings . The character of Dr . Pretorius is fantastic also . A wicked and obsessed man , who doesn't care about normal life . He's rude and emotionless and terrific as the bad guy in the story . The story opens with Mary Shelley telling the complete story . This immediately sets the perfect atmosphere which is held during the whole movie . No doubt about this . . . one of the greatest masterpieces ever seen . If you haven't seen it yet , do whatever it takes to get a copy ! ! ! I gave the original Frankenstein a rating , so I guess there isn't a rating that is high enough to praise The Bride of Frankenstein . Just as good as cinema can get ! ! !
The other ( and far more sadistic ) side of Mario Bava	Mario Bava , my personal favorite director of all time and generally speaking one of the best in the field of horror and cult cinema ever , surprises his foes and even more so his friends with this hugely atypical and shockingly nihilistic accomplishment in directing . Personally , I'm truly intrigued to find out what exactly encouraged or inspired Bava to make such a drastic change in style , especially considering his career was also undeniably entering its final stadium . Was it the initial enthusiasm and influence of his son Lamberto who was getting more closely involved in his father's productions ? Did Mario as well want to cash in on the contemporary hugely successful concept of super-violent crime thrillers ? Or perhaps he was really fed up with the arrogance of producers and critics after the flopping of " Lisa & The Devil " ? That particular Bava film was heavily altered against the will of Bava , because the producers wanted it to look more like " The Exorcist " , and the final result ? released as " House of Exorcism " and featuring extra footage of Telly Savalas ? became a huge failure . Who knows , maybe Bava really needed a break from the horror genre after this painful experience , and what better way is there to get rid of all your stress than by making a hard-boiled , outrageously violent , cruel and relentless thriller / action film ? Whatever his intentions were ( if any , because maybe I'm just speculating about nothing ) , Mario Bava's " Rabid Dogs " is one of the best films of its kind , and that is saying a lot because the early 70's Italian crime film industry was mostly ruled by other prominent directors , like Umberto Lenzi ( " Almost Human " , " Rome Armed to the Teeth " ) and Fernando Di Leo ( " Manhunt " , " Milano Calibre . 9 " ) . But " Rabid Dogs " benefices from one major advantage the others didn't have , namely ? Mario Bava in the director's seat ! Very few directors can deliver a movie that takes place inside a car for 90 % and doesn't get boring and even less filmmakers can take on a script packed with vulgarity & violence without ever losing sight of stylish photography and tension building . The film opens with an extended and ultra-grisly heist sequence that will already repulsive the mildly squeamish among us and it definitely doesn't get any softer from there . Three reckless gangsters referred to as Doc , Blade and Thirty-Two ( guess how he earned his nickname ? It surely isn't his age , neither his shoe size ) successfully pull off a heist but their getaway driver is killed by the police . They subsequently kidnap a woman , a middle-aged man and a sick child and force the driver to head for a still unknown location . What follows aren't wild car chases and violent encounters with patrolling police officers , but continuously brooding suspense inside the car and increasing fear and hostility between the gangsters and hostages as well as between the gangsters mutually . The trio's leader gradually loses influence over his companions whilst the others , and particularly Thirty-Two , behave increasingly perverse and misogynistic . The plot ends with a surprising , albeit implausibly grotesque twist that is well worth remembering ! " Rabid Dogs " is a heist / crime masterpiece with a nearly unequaled dark & disturbing atmosphere , extreme characters and a handful of stone-cold shock sequences . Throughout all the filthy substance and gritty violence , Mario Bava sustains his magnificent talent for imaginative camera-work and nifty lighting . The tight musical score , courtesy of Stelvio Cipriani , is sublime and definitely contributes to the atmosphere of claustrophobia and calamity . George Eastman depicts the absolute vilest criminal of the trio , which shouldn't come as a big surprise as he's Italy's most unscrupulous & sleazy exploitation icon . He wrote and starred in numerous of the smuttiest horror movies ever made , including " Antropophagus " , " Absurd " and " Erotic Nights of the Living Dead " . I don't daresay how important " Rabid Dogs " was or how much it influenced other filmmakers , because the film only got re-discovered and completed not that long ago . It is said it heavily influenced the earliest work of Quentin Tarantino ( " Reservoir Dogs " ) and the entire career of Martin Scorsese . It's definitely a nice thought , but even without historical value or groundbreaking impacts " Rabid Dogs " remains a must see for all fanatics of cult cinema . As I die-hard Gothic & Giallo fanatic , I still prefer Bava's horror-orientated masterpieces , but this was nonetheless and unforgettable and perplexing film experience . Mr . Bava , you were a God and may you forever rest in peace .
It's a plan all right ? A plan for perfect entertainment ! !	What are all these people moaning about ? I've rarely had more fun while watching a movie as I had with Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space . Besides , most criticism goes out to the lousy scenery and the goofy decors . Well excuse Mr . Wood for not disposing over a huge budget or funds ! He did what he could and sure , the jet cockpit looks amateurish and the Pentagon-offices have the image of being build by a kindergarten-crew but so what ? I have a lot more respect and sympathy for this film than for those over-budgeted , uninspired blockbusters ! Like in ALL of his films , Ed Wood proves that he's full of good intentions , creativity and a strong will to proceed and purchase his dreams . The only thing you can reproach him here , is the silly and pointless screenplay . Aliens are desperately seeking contact with humanity and in their ninth attempt to achieve this , they even resurrect the dead . Why ? ! ? To make humans aware of their existence and to figure as prophets with a message . This is where the silliness comes in . But it all remains pure fun , all the time ! What also makes this film legendary is the fact that it contains the last on-screen appearance by Bela Lugosi . Lugosi died during filming and another guy in a Dracula outfit who constantly hides his face behind a cape ( ! ) replaces him . Am I the only one who thinks this subtle cast-change is absolutely charming and nicely tried ? Vampiria and Tor Johnson are credited as main performances but all the have to do is stumble around and look ghoulish ? not a difficult thing to do if you have the posture of Tor Johnson . Overall , Plan 9 from Outer Space remains the absolute top-recommendation to watch with a group of people when there's beer and snacks .
