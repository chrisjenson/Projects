What A Waste Of Money	This contains some 8mm footage of the DOCTOR WHO stories , The Smugglers , The Abominable Snowmen , and The Daemons . Unfortunately these clips ( Shown out of context I might add ) are the only decent moments from one of the most disgraceful video releases ever inflicted onto the public . First of all , because of copyright reasons , THE DOCTORS doesn't include any clips from the show itself ! Yes that's right , a video ( Though I saw this on DVD ) about DOCTOR WHO doesn't include any clips from DOCTOR WHO . Strange how this isn't mentioned on the video box , instead we're " treated " to 80 minutes of mind numbing talking head interviews with still photos . What about the interviews ? Well with the exception of the late Jon Pertwee saying the show shouldn't be brought back there's nothing here that I haven't heard before , and are Don Henderson , Brian Blessed and Sally Faulkner - All of whom have appeared in one DOCTOR WHO story each - really going to give much insight into the show ? It should also be pointed out it was Donald Wilson who got Sydney Newman's idea for the show off the ground , not as is insinuated by Shuan Sutton . There's also too much product placement on sale here with plugs for video spin off tales which are more often than not produced by Bill Baggs , the producer of this piece of crapAnother thing I detested about this video was something so bad it deserved its own paragraph - THE PICTURE QUALITY IS ABSOLUTELY DREADFUL . I've seen pirated porn films with better picture quality , and no it's not down to a dodgy video copy either , I've seen umpteen other comments about how poor the picture quality is from other fans of the show on other websitesI got this as a gift from my mother and felt that I had been ripped off even if it didn't cost me a penny . No doubt the producers of this released it knowing how gullible some DOCTOR WHO fans are , well I've got a message for them - I'm no schmuck . If you're thinking of buying this please think again , and do not confuse it with the classic video DOCTOR WHO : 30 YEARS IN THE TARDIS
Not Really A Horror Movie	I think there's a straight to video film called OCTOPUS which spends the first half of its running time being an action packed thriller ( Or meekly tries to ) then all of a sudden turns into a horror movie about a giant octopus . Well it's the same with PORTRAIT OF A VAMPIRE which opens with a very brief scene with a Jerry Springer lookalike examining a body drained of blood then the film flashes back to Afghanistan in August 1989 ( Hadn't the red army pulled out of there before then ? ) which resembles the Nex Mexico desert . Not very convincing but it gets worse as we're treated to a battle scene featuring CGI helicopters . How do I know they're CGI ? Well it's so obvious it's impossible not to notice . It's also impossible not to notice the pathetic standard of acting either and it's at this point the script decides to meet the production's dismal standards as it bores us ( No spoilers because you can see it coming a mile away ) with double and triple crosses in Mexico a year later . It's at this point you find yourself asking what have I got to do to get an equity card ? , or how come film companies turn my scripts down when they finance crap like this ? and most importantly if this movie is called PORTRAIT OF A VAMPIRE then shouldn't it be a horror film and not a crap action thriller similar to something Cannon used to produce in the mid 1980s ? It does turn into a horror movie about halfway through but the horror aspects are as badly done as the action adventure bits . I was going to feel sorry for Gary Busey appearing in this but it's not like someone stuck a gun to head and made him do it . If you decide to appear in a film like this it's your own fault and you deserve no sympathySo just to sum up if you enjoy horror films you won't want to see this because it's not a horror film , it's a horrible film . And if you enjoy action films you won't want to see it either due to the laughable production values
Written And Directed By Prof Richard Dawkins Perhaps ?	I wasn't expecting much from this so called prequel since the original was fairly bad but I didn't expect it to be this terrible First of all we're introduced to a family whose house is haunted by an evil spirit but I wonder how much spirits the producers consumed to make a movie this bad ? Watch the opening half hour and you'll genuinely believe it has been edited in an entirely random manner with several reels missing altogether . Words fail to describe the totally disjointed matter of the narrative Secondly there's the portrayal of religion . Why is it that these haunted house stories only happen to catholics ? Ask yourself this : when was the last time you watched a film and Mr and Mrs Goldberg find their house is haunted by Satan . It's certainly not a film that was produced for catholics in mind since we see a pervy priest . Having said that he's not the most pervy character in the movie since there's an incest subplot and of course mass murder . Just another day in the life of a church going family Throughout the film I thought Professor Richard Dawkins might have produced this dire pile of crap . Dawkins if you didn't know is the world's leading atheist philosopher . He describes all religions as " superstitious nonsense " which is a good way to describe this movie . Dawkins as far as I know has never attended film school which shows . If Dawkins wasn't behind this cinematic atrocity then I'm afraid everyone involved in it should stop making films . For goodness sake there's even a " he woke up and it was all a dream " sequence and story telling doesn't get more insipid than that
A Real Disaster Of A Movie	! ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! Suppose you were in deadly danger and needed to be totally anon , what would you do ? If you answered " Hide in a cave " you'd probably be right . If you answered something along the lines of " Become a singing sensation at a Las Vegas casino " then you'd probably be carted off somewhere to be force fed anti-psychotic pills . Alternatively you could also be invited to write a script . Guess what ? someone was invited to write a script and it's called DISASTER . Tracy is on the run from a Cult ( That's not a spelling mistake by the way ) and decides to hide out in Vegas as a star singer who's so famous her posters are plastered everywhere . Oh and she doesn't even bother to change her name , only her hairstyle . Do you think this is credible ? Can we expect to see a duo called Osama and Saddam singing The Desert Song at a downtown casino in the near future ? but who needs credibility when you've got Yossi Wein as director Yossi Wein directed such fare as DEATH TRAIN , US SEALS and OCTOPUS 2 so you know what to expect ie not much . If DEATH TRAIN resembled UNDER Siege 2 then DISASTER resembles the original DIE HARD except it's set in a casino , has little in the way of budget , with an unimpressive cast . It's also obvious the bad guy was written with a slimy limey actor in mind but couldn't get Rickman , Oldman or Bean ( Possibly because they saw the script ? ) so a plank of wood was cast instead . In fact I felt really sorry for Mr plank because there's so many flaming explosions in this film ( That's all there is in this movie - explosions ) and I was really worried he might get turned into charcoal Which reminds me the special effects of cars , helicopters and buildings going up in flames are obviously achieved by setting fire to toys - Some child is going to be very upset on Christmas day - while the more convincing . . . sorry less unconvincing effects seem to be stolen from other movies I think Despite all this I couldn't help noticing Tracy has a well developed pair of lungs so maybe her career as a singer isn't as ridiculous as it seemed at first . Tracy's lungs were the only reason I didn't off the TV
Makes THE FAST AND FURIOUS Look Like GONE WITH THE WIN	What did Sylvester Stallone do in order to be credited as writing the screenplay ? I was under the impression that there's no screenplay involved and certainly no story . All that seems to happen in this movie is that a young hunky racing driver called Jimmy drives round a racing track against a musical soundtrack , Jimmy gets out of car , music stops , Jimmy gives a moody look , blonde bimbo has something in her eye , Sly appears mumbles something and walks away , Burt Reynolds appear wearing a gray wig and shades looking like Davros from DOCTOR WHO , Jimmy plays computer game and gives a moody look , cue the music because Jimmy has spotted another blonde bimbo walking in slo mo , Jimmy looks very moody . Its like this all the way through as if director Renny Harlin has decided to make a pop video for MTV instead of a feature film . In other words it's film making of the most shallow order
Very Disappointing	I'm not much of a fan of horror movies but I looked forward to seeing CHERRY FALLS simply because the director Geoffry Wright is the man who brought us ROMPER STOMPER , a movie that brings a whole new meaning to violent realism . Alas CHERRY FALLS is a major disappointment . I don't know what it is about gifted non American directors but as soon as they land at LA airport they seem to leave their talent behind at the arrival lounge , Wolfgang Petersen being the best example . I'm not sure if the director is having an off day or if the cast are , but Wright is unable to get anything more than mediocre performances from the cast . Check the scene where the sheriff walks into class after the first two murders have been commited , it's difficult to believe the usually competent Michael Biehn has ever had an acting lesson in his life as he delivers his lines with the passion of a speak your weight machine . As the rest of the direction in the movie it's very flat . The script by Ken Selden is both dumb and unoriginal . A lot of people on this site have compared it to SCREAM but I doubt if the two are comparable . CHERRY FALLS lacks the post modernist humour , wit and originality of SCREAM and I'm not even sure if it's meant to be a darkly comic movie . The script shows signs of underdevelopment and contains several major plot holes . For example after the first murders the pathologist examines the bodies and realises the female is a virgin but it's never explained why the authorities conclude the murders were carried out because the victims were virgins . Perhaps the biggest plot hole is this : How on earth would the killer know his victims were virgins ? Go back to your own teenage years and you'll realise there's nothing more unrealiable than school gossip especially if it involves the sexual habits of school mates . Never listen to gossip and don't watch CHERRY FALLS unless you're addicted to teenagers getting stalked and killed by a knife wielding looney
Rather Nasty And Lacking In Character Development	Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC : " It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner " " And after GLC what next for Bronson ? " " We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same " This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO . It's a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained Bronson is a retired hit-man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of " The Doctor " , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . It's never really explained why The Doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents As you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like The Doctor's sister being a lesbian so some T & A can be included In many ways it's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on Sunday afternoons . Believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed
Gives Cult Film Making A Bad Name	" Blue . It's a colour so cruel " sang The Fine Young Cannibals . BLUE by Derek Jarman can't be described as being cruel in anyway , but that's probably the kindest thing I can say about this movie , I can find a thousand adjectives none of them complimentary to describe BLUE . The idea of art for arts sake sickens me and the idea of watching a " movie " composed of a blue background with a narrator speaking from everything from Bosnian refugees to death doesn't appeal to me even if it does contain ambient muzak and sound effects . I do confess that I watched BLUE when it recieved its TV premiere on channel 4 a few years ago but that was only down to the publicity surrounding it and you have to ask if it was made by a mainstream director who was dying from lung cancer would it have been given the same hype ?
No Brains And No Laughs	I wished I'd taped MEN IN WHITE so I could watch it again " What ? You mean you really enjoyed it Theo ? " No I mean I could watch it again to see if it was as retarded , stupid and as embarrassingly unfunny as I can remember it A lot of people have claimed it was made for children . May I suggest it was also made by children ? because the whole structure of the script lacks any type of discipline on the part of the producers and writers and much of set pieces seem to have been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time The cast don't help but I genuinely started to feel sorry for them . Honestly you can believe that during filming the cast had to lie to their families that they were filming a hard core porn film such was their embarrassment at having to appear in something as dismal as this . To give you an idea of how bad the acting is every time BAYWATCH babe Donna D'Ericco disappeared from the narrative I waited patiently for her to reappear then seconds later I forgot she was in the movie . Got that ? A star from BAYWATCH appears and seconds later you forget they're in the movie . This tells you all you need to know about the standard of MEN IN WHITE Fair enough it's trying to be a live action cartoon similar to THE GOODIES ( Although THE DISMALS would be a better adjective for this movie ) , though perhaps the movie deserves some credit for never descending to toilet humour , but considering this is a kids movie ( This didn't stop ITV broadcasting it at 11 pm ) then there should be no near the knuckle humour in it anyway
Confused	I remember seeing another of these DEFENDERS TVMs about a year ago and not thinking muchh of it down to a lack of credibility . PAYBACK is slightly different in tone but again it's not very enjoyable and suffers from the same type of problems many other TVMs suffer from ! ! ! ! SLIGHT SPOILERS ! ! ! ! Michael Lane shoots the man who molested his daughter seven years before and the story centres around his trial . However there does seem to be some slight confusion as to what this TVM is trying to say . Is the defendant the good guy or the bad guy ? In a movie like DEATH WISH or THE EXTERMINATOR the audience sympathies lie with the man who blows away lots and lots of criminals . We're not allowed to question wether executing someone who hasn't commited a crime against the avenging vigilante deserved it or not because the criminal volunteered to become a criminal and therefore brought their fate upon themselves . These vigilante thrillers scream that it's okay to kill guilty people but that it's wrong to rob , rape or kill innocent people a view if we were to be honest most people would agree with . PAYBACK is different because it's revealed that the man who raped and sodomised an eight year child was once a victim of child abuse himself and after being jailed for seven years is rehabilitated . This has a somewhat liberal subtext as we're always being told by the bleeding heart liberal lobby that rehabilitation is the only way to deal with sex offenders so in many ways PAY BACK has a liberal agenda . However we're shown the distress and family destruction of what the actions of this paedophile has done to the Lanes and in another scene which ironically features the paedophile's wife it's pointed out that revenge is never enough no matter what punishment is inflicted legal or otherwise . Of course some people may claim that PAYBACK is trying to be subjective , but the sub text is confused more than anything . It would have perhaps worked better if the script had cut out all the mawkish stuff like Michael Lane's abused daughter running from the court . I would have actually preferred a different angle to the story like maybe how the authorities are fairly useless at protecting innocent members of society from sexual predators . I don't know how things are in America but over here in Britain convicted sex offenders seem to have more rights than the victims they abused hence our admiration for people who take the law into their own hands
This Film Is Gay	KIDS IN THE HALL ? This is a sketch show I remembered being broadcast in the wee small hours in Britain on channel 4 . I didn't think much of it . No strike that - I hated it . It was composed of a bunch of Canadian MONTY PYTHON wannabes who dressed in drag more often than not and made sketches that fell flat . I can remember the " I'm crushing your head " character because of the simple reason it was so unfunny and it's no surprise that Canadians I know much prefer British TV like THE OFFICE and DOCTOR WHOBRAIN CANDY is a feature length film by the KITH troupe and as many people have already pointed out you'll only enjoy this movie if you're already a fan , if you've never heard of these kids you will probably dislike with a vengeance with the humour being either underdeveloped or plain crude like the scene where a NCO orders one of his men into battle : " You see these two men beside the wall ? You run over there and fck them while we stay here and masturbate " I also couldn't help thinking that because BRAIN CANDY is a spin off from a sketch show the screenplay lacks cohesion , events and scenes happen without any rhyme nor reason like for example a scene cutting to a music award show where Cancer Boy performs a song only for the action to then cut away to another location with Cancer Boy then absent for the rest of the filmI certainly didn't enjoy BRAIN CANDY and unless you're a KIDS IN THE HALL fan or someone who enjoys watching men dress up as woman it's highly likely you'll feel the same way
The Reason Britain Doesn't Have A Film Industry	When people talk about British film success in the 1980s they instantly think of CHARIOTS OF FIRE , GHANDI , THE KILLING FIELDS and THE MISSION . What a lot of people forget is that during this period a television station , Channel 4 , were the main sponsors of British films and almost every week ( Or so it seemed ) we'd see an unwatchable art house piece of crap by Derek Jarman or Peter Greenaway hit the limited film circuit . Add SHADEY to the list of shame ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I haven't seen SHADEY for several years and I can guarantee you that I won't be seeing it again . It's a black comedy which is the most vague and audience unfriendly genre title there is . Oliver Shadey ( Played by Anthony Sher who spends the entire movie with a gormless grin over his face ) is a man who wants to become a woman and has somewhat supernatural powers . This premise is bizarre but is not beyond saving . What ruins the story is the way the production team try to shock the audience . Shadey gets emasculated by a pair of scissors , Patrick Macnee and Leslie Ash's characters embark on an incestuous relationship and we have to endure dialogue like " When Jesus told his followers to get behind me did he show himself to be a latent homosexual ? " . Shadey also escapes in a lift as the South African secret police pursue him in a climax that is even worse than it sounds I've no idea what the market was for this type of movie . It's pretentious , irritating and throughly unentertaining . It smacks of a bunch of untalented smug art house types getting their film funded by some equally pretentious art house types who sycophantically admired the script simply because it's so anti mainstream . This type of attitude destroyed the 1980s British industry with movies that couldn't be distributed in Britain never mind internationally ( It's no surprise that Americans have given this an even lower average vote that the Brits ) and I never want to see the British film industry suffer such a low point again
Totally Immoral	Paul Cunningham is a man who is in serious trouble because he owes a bookie money who is perhaps not the sort of person who will go through the courts to get his money back . Paul has till the end of next week to pay back £1800 or else . On his way home he witnesses a homeless man being beaten up ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! I don't care if I'm upsetting anyone who reads this but I absolutely hated Jamie Palmer's short film PAUL'S LUCKY DAY . It gives immorality a bad name . Paul takes a homeless man , a victim of a mugging back to his flat and when he finds out he has the winning numbers on a lottery ticket he suffocates him . There you go , we're asked to empathise with a murderer , we're asked to feel happy that a murderer has won the lottery , I don't think so . There's also a massive plot hole involved here because if you suffocate someone with a pillow this will show up in a post Morten . Considering the homeless man has died in very suspicious circumstances a post morten would be compulsory and yet the pathologist hasn't noticed the cause of death Morality - Or rather the lack of it - aside , PAUL'S LUCKY DAY is something of a failure on the technical side . This short is filmed in murky monochrome which isn't pleasing to the eye but it's the sound mix which is the major irritant since I could hardly make out a bloody word that was being spoken Paul might have been lucky . I doubt if anyone watching this will feel the same way
Elrond Kisses Men ! ! ! ! !	Let's get one thing straight ( Geddit ? ) BEDROOMS AND HALLWAYS is a film that will appeal to no one regardless of their sexuality . Gays will hate it because of the portrayal of gay men as being camp neurotics while straights will hate it because there is zero entertainment to be found in men snogging each other senseless But what I found hateful is the casting of Hugo Weaving as a gay man . Yes THAT Hugo Weaving , Elrond from LORD OF THE RINGS , Elrond father of Arwen , Elrond who lectured his daughter on love in THE TWO TOWERS . From now on I'll be having nightmares about the third LOTR film being called Return of the QUEEN
Maybe I'm Too Old For This	I was very disappointed with TEACHING MRS TINGLE because as it was written and directed by Kevin Williamson I was expecting a smart post modernist black comedy deconstructing other movies with kidnapping as a theme but this doesn't really happen , in short there's little idiosyncratic style from the man who wrote the screenplays for the SCREAM movies , and am I alone in getting slightly fed up with Williamson having his protagonists in each and every of his screenplays high school kids ?
Bad Idea	When I say " Doctor Who " you might conjure up an image of Tom Baker , or Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison . When I say " James Bond " you'll almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery while a small handful of people may think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan . But when I say " Sgt Bilko " absolutely everyone will think of Phil Silvers . Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor . And that's the problem with this film version you'll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show . In fact the whole idea of making a film version of BILKO without Silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
Seen It All Before	I can imagine the pitch at the TV execs office went something like this " You know what everyone watches at the cinema these days ? Disaster movies , so let's get everyone out of the cinema back into the home with a disaster movie for TV " " Great idea . We'll get a well known TV actor and some Oscar winning actor everyone has forgotten about . How we gonna come up with a new slant on the genre ? " " that's easy we set it on a plane just like in AIRPORT except , except there's a mad psycho killer aboard the plane . We could even get that crazy guy from EARTHQUAKE to play the psycho " " With an idea and casting like that that there's no way we can fail with this TV movie " I beg to differ because as someone who's seen MAYDAY AT 40 , 000 FEET it is a failure because someone forgot to write an interesting script
Is There A Difference Between a Romantic Comedy And A Sex Comedy ?	Matt Sullivan has just suffered a break up from the love of his life so has decided to give up sex for lent . Unfortunately he then meets the real love of his life called Erica . When I say " Unfortunately " I meant unfortunately for Matt and his vow of celibacy . Unfortunately for me I decided to watch this film because there was nothing else on . I was under the impression that 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS was going to be a romantic comedy , something fairly gentle and forgettable but not totally unwatchable but alas it's a sex comedy and there is a difference . With this type of movie it tries to be gross and juvenile and for the first half it succeeds ( Not my type of movie ) but strangely for the second half it does try to be somewhat romantic which means for the lads who might have enjoyed the crass humour earlier in the movie have to watch a relationship movie and I guess all the girlies who watched because the of touted pretty boy lead must have been put off with the gross humour at the start so as is often the case when you make a movie trying to appeal to both males and females you end up - Like a poor bisexual lover - satisfying neither camp Josh Hartnett ? He starred in PEARL HARBOR which through no fault of his own was one of the biggest piles of horse manure that Hollywood produced in years , yeah he was fairly impressive in BLACK HAWK DOWN but the real star of BHD was Ridley Scott's technical achievements . With a movie like 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS the whole film rests on the leads shoulders and it's fairly clear that Hartnett can't carry a movie on his performance alone . I shouldn't condemn him too much since the script is very poor and does raise some idiotic questions like if Matt is a devout catholic then we does he have sex outside of marriage and use a condom ?
Reminds Me Of Other ( Poor ) British Comedy Thrillers	FIVE SECONDS TO SPARE is yet another British movie made at the turn of the century that can't decide want it wants to be and instantly reminded me of countless other British films that came out at the same time proving yet again that if you want to get your movie financied knowing people in the business is imperative while possessing screen writing skills is not a priority The story starts with our protagonist William witnessing a gruesome murder . The narrative then jumps back in time and shows us that William is a budding musician who has moved to London as a career move . It's at this point FIVE SECONDS TO SPARE decides it's going to be a comedy and I can't communicate how the opening murder jars with everything else in the story . Anyone seen YOUNG SOUL REBELS ? This was another British movie that opened with a murder then for some inexplicable reason decided it was going to be about the London soul scene in the 1970s . If a movie starts with a bloody murder shouldn't it remain a thriller and not become a comedy ? The movie also suffers from too many pointless cameos . Anyone seen MAD COWS ? We've got John Peel playing himself along with Ray Winston playing . . . well Ray Winston . We've also got Sean Pertwee who obviously just turned up so he could say he's appeared in every British movie made in the last five years and since Keith Allen was busy that week we've got Andy Serkis playing Allen's role . If the " Brit Pack " want to get together can't they just meet up at someones house instead of producing a movie ? And like MAD COWS the humour is silly and unconvincing instead of being funny I could spend a lot of time dissecting what is wrong with this movie but I can't really be bothered except to say it's yet another British movie that was rushed into production with a painfully underdeveloped script . No doubt the people who worked on FIVE SECONDS TO SPARE had a great time unlike the audience and if you've got a couple of hours to spare I'm sure it can be spent more wisely than watching this
Not So Much Scream . . . .	. . . As a yawn - a very big yawn I must be getting old because I have trouble watching two horror films in a row . I'd previously just seen SEVERED which is also known to this reviewer as 28 BADLY DIRECTED TRIFFIDS LATER and had difficulty in staying awake watching THE DEAD HATE THE LIVING . This probably sums up the problem with the movie in that it's fairly inoffensive and unmemorable so makes little impression on its intended market . It's obviously produced to tie in with the SCREAM franchise but that series was far from being the witty post modernist genius some claim it to be so right away you're being influenced by something that wasn't very good to begin with which leads to ZZZZZZZZZZ
There's Such A Thing As Being Too Realistic	This might sound ridiculous but it wasn't until 1991 that I got into De Niro , Keitel and Scorsese in a big way . I'd just seen the classic TAXI DRIVER and eagerly got my dad to tape MEAN STREETS off Sky television . Unfortunately I thought I'd either given my dad a bad tape or the video hadn't been tuned into the TV station properly since the picture quality was very poor and everything was filmed in a sickly red colour and that's just the bits I could make out because for most of the movie the contrast was terrible with everything being dimly lit . It wasn't until a couple of nights ago when I saw MEAN STREETS on network TV that I realised that the poor picture quality wasn't anything to do with duff videotapes or out of tune video recorders - It was down to the fact that the original print suffers from some terrible lighting and cinematography that gives the impression that the movie was made on 8mm by a bunch of twelve year old boysThat's bad enough but what brings the film down ( And I noticed this on first viewing in 1991 ) is that Scorsese has forgotten to write a plot to his screenplay . I think Martin Scorsese is god where making movies is concerned but not even he can escape criticism by making a movie that goes nowhere . For the most part MEAN STREETS resembles those Harry Endfield characters The Scousers with New York accents " You alright Johnny Boy ? " " You asking me if I'm alright ? " " Yeah I am . What the f you gonna do about it ? " It's like this all the way through the running time up until the last ten minutes when Marty finally realises he's got to introduce an incident in order to finish the film The acting from Harvey Keitel is totally convincing while De Niro is superb ( Something that can't be said for most of his recent performances ) but by writing a low concept hyper realistic screenplay Scorsese has effectively ruined the movie in its conception . Ask yourself this : If the driving force behind the movie wasn't Martin Scorsese would you have regarded MEAN STREETS so highly ?
Shallow Doesn't Even Begin To Describe It	In order to enjoy STEAL ( As it's known in the UK ) there's several things you must do 1 ) Switch off your brain 2 ) Develop an interest in extreme sports 3 ) Be aged between twelve and seventeen I have a problem with all of the above especially the third one which meant I couldn't enjoy this movie and I'm sure anyone not in the aforementioned age bracket will have a problem with this movie which can be best described as " MTV Xtreme Sports Meets THE A-TEAM " Everything about this movie is geared towards the cool visuals which means the editing and cinematography and stunts are excellent to the detriment of everything else , it's almost like a recruiting advert for bank robbery done in a comic book manner with no characterisation , minimalist dialogue and some atrocious acting The cast ? OMG the cast . You know when you watch a Hollywood movie and it's the Brits who give the best performances ? Well here it's the other way round with Bruce Payne and Steven Berkoff heads and shoulders below everybody else . Berkoff especially is stand out in his awfulness and considering the poor performances all round he should be ashamed of himself , it's amazing this guy is still allowed an Equity card The whole screenplay is written around the spectacular set pieces and to be fair the editing and cinematography do make them spectacular but there's too much gaps in logic involved which makes an unlikely story even more dumb . Without giving too much away one heist involves a freelancer getting very naughty which means the team ( Who are portrayed as being self righteously opposed to killing ) leave this guy to his fate by escaping but they do so in a ridiculous manner which meant if the goon had behaved himself they would still have left him via this method . What sort of morality is this ? Did the writers think no one would have noticed ? Not really worth your time watching except for the stunts or unless you're addicted to the MTV channels
Disappointing	Poets ? They're a bit gay aren't they ? Usually they're middle class and middle aged and they get ripped off by scam merchants who post adverts saying " Send us your poetry submissions for our best selling anthology book of erotic poetry and don't forget to enclose $30 for administration costs " In short there's nothing less cool than poetry but Miguel Pinero made the genre cool , streetwise and sexy and he deserved a far better biopic than this I'd never heard of the guy until I saw this movie . A remarkable life story of a man who spent time in the big house and soon achieved critical acclaim via his plays and poetry . He wrote a play called SHORT EYES set in a prison , a play that was turned into a film . Just out of curiosity I went to this site and looked it up . The phrase " short eyes " is American prison slang for a child molester the lowest of the low in any penal system . It's also a movie that IMDb reviewers have greatly praised . Now why did I have to visit this site to find out the remarkable story behind the making of the film ( Check out the trivia page on SHORT EYES - I guarantee you'll be amazed ) if I was watching a biopic on the play write behind it ? By trying to show us how cool and streetwise the eponymous character is the director / screenwriter fails to show us anything about Miguel Pinero the man apart from that he swore and took a lot of drugs which hardly made him a unique individual . The story slips in time and space , from colour to monochrome and has characters appearing and disappearing in a haphazard manner . Miguel Pinero made poetry the new street culture and he probably deserved a better film telling his life story
Not One I'd Watch	Some people have criticised the way this film is directed but my own complaint is the way it's produced and it's probably not a valid complaint because it's produced unreservedly for a female audience , though strangely enough male voters on this site have awarded it a slightly higher mark than females Apart from being the kind of movie that twenty something females can get together and watch on a Friday night with a bottle of wine it's difficult to understand the thinking behind it . Is it a star vehicle for Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz ? If so why put two up and coming actresses in the same movie because they cancel each other out and Diaz role as Heather does seem slightly underwritten . In this type of movie people in general and men in particular never really act as they would in real life and while I'm not a fan of " social realism " in movies neither am I a fan of romantic comedies / chick flicks either Not to be to negative I did smile at at the line : " She looks like she came from an island " " Yeah Rhode Island "
A Lot Of People Have Complained About the Ending . . .	. . . But I'm afraid that the beginning and the middle isn't much better either ! This is a very strange film that doesn't seem to be able to decide what it's wanting to be . Is it a smart mind blowing technical thriller or is it film noir ? Whatever it is it fails on both counts since the techno thriller aspects are confused and muddled ( Don't forget nearly everyone is complaining about the ending ) while the film noir story is heavily let down by the production values " Let down how Theo ? " You ask me an obvious question like that ? Check the actor playing hero Douglas Hall . I'm afraid Craig Bierko seems to have used William Shatner as as an acting tutor . Hall seems in a permanent state of angst and talks through gritted teeth in nearly every single scene he appears in and this audience member is none the wiser why this should be . The idea of film noir is taken too literally as it's very difficult to see what's happening on screen half the time since the producers seem to have cut costs on the lighting bill which is a shame since the production design might have been good if I could actually make out the sets which I can't I guess THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR might have had potential and there are a few scenes where the plot twists are impressive notably the scene in 1937 when Douglas goes up to a bar and finds the bar tender is . . . ! but the overall plot is let down because the script is painfully underdeveloped or has been re-written to death and it's up to you to decide what one
Seen This Before Somewhere	The plot for this straight to video production revolves around the teenage characters of Sebastian Valmont and Kathryan Merteuil who embark on a pact to manipulate all those around them . Their most favoured type of manipulation is seducing naive young virgins You're possibly scratching your head wondering where you've seen this plot before since it seems very similar to another movie . More likely you're doing a bit of spluttering something along the lines of " That sounds just like the plot of the original CRUEL INTENTIONS , a movie that was released in the cinemas a year before . I'm all for recycling in these environmentally aware times but reusing the same plot within twelve months is ridiculous " and you'd be right . It's ridiculous a sequel to a film that was a reworking of another movie is released a year later What you think of this movie is down to what you thought of CRUEL INTENTIONS . It's impossible to like one and dislike the other , it's impossible to hate one and love the other down to the fact that they both share the same story . I have to be honest and say I didn't think much of the original ( The movie with Sarah Michelle Geller , not the one with John Malcovic and Glenn Close ) , a rather shallow movie made for the teen market which is an identical description for the sequel . Not to be too negative it's one of the few straight to video productions that I've seen that doesn't cull scenes from other movies ( Yeah I know the entire script by Roger Kumble follows the first movie but you know what I'm saying ) or stars Treat Williams as an action hero
Good Books Don't Make For Good Movies	I've never read Robert Harris's book ENIGMA so I don't know how it compares to the very highly regarded FATHERLAND , and also having never read the book I obviously have no idea how it compares to this film version but I cant help thinking the book is being close to unfilmable . No doubt Harris burnt a very large amount of midnight oil meticulously researching the history of Bletchley park and of the enigma codes ( I think you'll find Harris's account of the enigma codes differs somewhat from what we saw in the Hollywood movie U-571 ) , the screenplay here features lots of subplots involving trying to break a Nazi code within four days , a man recovering from a breakdown , a failed relationship , another relationship , and the possible existance of a Nazi spy but the subplots don't really gel enough to make an interesting story . Mind you the sense of time and place is , I imagine , superlative
Someone Is Confused	To me science fiction is about the exploration of the human condition , it's a sweeping genre replete with allegory , analogy and subtext . It would appear that Nicholas Brooks and Laura Kelly haven't grasped this concept since their short film OZONE doesn't easily fit into the science fiction category per se and seems to be more about visual style hardly surprising after I read their resumes at this site The story starts with some excruiating violin music which is a pain on the ears as Martin Dwyer walks up a flight of stairs into a building where he then checks in only to be told that the person he wants to see lives on the two hundredth floor . The narrative to this story is very poor as both Brooks and Kelly are far more interested in visuals and production design and I doubt if they have much understanding for the SF genre . . Certainly I had a hard time understanding what OZONE was about and where it might be heading
The Personification Of The TVM	Why do do TV companies insist on churning out these fem friendly disease of the week TVMs ? It's easily explained . Imagine a fourty something woman zapping through the channels trying to find something to watch after a hard days work . What's on ? HAMBURGER HILL - A Vietnam war film . PLATOON - A Vietnam war film . FULL METAL JACKET - A Vietnam war film . BLACK HAWK DOWN - A movie not set in Vietnam and yes it's a war film . So Mrs fourty something comes to the conclusion that unless you like seeing human beings kill one another there's no point in subscribing to movie channels so therefore TV companies contribute to a very real market of movies where the main protagonist is female And I couldn't help thinking SUDDENLY is the most typical of these type of TVMs . Kirstie Alley plays Marty a woman who works in a diner and is just too sassy and fun loving to be true . You do get the impression that if she was miserable and introverted destiny would bless her with good health and a long life but as with all these other type of movies produced by TV companies bad things happen to nice women and she finds herself facing eternity in a wheelchair As you can imagine SUDDENLY plays out like you'd expect it to . There's a lot of bitterness from Marty , a romantic subplot , a really cute dog ( Though thankfully the romance doesn't involve the dog ) and a lecture on how to enjoy sex if you're a paraplegic . I do have to admit BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY was much better but then again I'm a male who likes Vietnam war movies
They Don't Make ' Em Like This Nowadays	My instant reaction on watching this in 2003 is the portrayal of the Muslim faith . Without giving too much away the plot centres around protecting a Muslim icon , while Muslims who are not exacatly treated with total reverance aren't shown as being blood thirsty killers calling for jihad against westerners either . Compare this movie with something like TRUE LIES and you'll see how differently Hollywood treats Islam these days . That said I don't want anyone to think this is a piece of must see cinema . YOU CAN'T WIN ' EM ALL is basically a buddy B movie made to shown before a main feature , if you're under 35 you won't be able to remember the days when you paid money at the box office and got to see TWO feature films . Charles Bronson plays a world weary skipper while Tony Curtis - Who shocked cinema audiences in THE BOSTON STRANGLER two years before - plays an irritating smart ass similar to his role in THE PERSUADERS in early 1920s Turkey . Watch out for the anachronism when someone mentions " Starting world war two " which is strange because no one ever spoke about " World war one " in those days , not even the cast of PEARL HARBOR
Too Much Of A Long Voyage	This has all the feeling of a 1980s disaster movie with its big name all star cast . Alas British audiences will be distracted by the opening sequence where a cruel Nazi is played by the legendary Leonard Rossiter . These type of casting choices can sometimes ruin a movie and iut's not helped by having cameos by megastars like Orson Welles and James Mason in blink and you'll miss them roles . That said the cast do seem more interested in giving good performances rather than enjoying themselves which isn't always the case with movies with a large cast of big names . Special mention should go to Paul Koslo was very prolific in 1970s B movies and who appeared in some utterly pathetic movies in the 80s and 90s , while the always excellent Johnathan Pryce shows us what he can do in an early role . Max Von Sydow as Captain Schroeder gives the best performance in the movieAll the cast do their best but it's really the script that is at fault . I did mention Von Sydow's acting performance as Schroeder , but you often feel his character is written as a litery point illustrating party member = bad , non party member = good , this point feels too forced and unsubtle . Remember it's when people become indifferent that bad things happen , not when they join a political party . I don't want to mention this but Erwin Rommel was a member of the Nazi party and he was the most respected German general by the allies because of his code of chilvary while many Wermacht non party members committed war crimes every bit as brutal as their SS counterparts so don't be fooled that everything is as black and white as seen here , as the caption at the end shows Schroeder himself was questioned about crimes against humanity after the war There's a couple of other flaws with the script . Aaron Pozner is shown being beaten to a pulp by some SA brownshirts in 1939 which is strange considering the SA were liquidated by Hitler in 1934 and lets be blunt in saying that the movie is at least half an hour too long . This is often a problem with a great number of movies featuring anti semitism 1933-45 in that by showing us mans inhumanity to man they often feel the need to labour the point home of the cruelty of the regime and the victims fear when in fact less would been more . It could also be that this is always not a very good subject to base a movie around especially when there's documentaries like THE WORLD AT WAR that shows the very real horrors of what the Nazis did to their victims
Clumsy Adaptation Of An Unfilmable Novel	The problem with filming Matheson's I AM LEGEND is that the original novel is so difficult to adapt for the silver screen . The novel deals with the last man alive - Neville - who is surrounded by vampires . There's little spoken dialogue and perhaps most problamatic of all is the fact that Neville is effectively the villain meaning that a cinema audience have to identify and empathise with a bad guy maliciously killing benign vampires . Obviously this is a step too far for a mainstream audience so any film producer filming this story needs to make Neville a good guy thereby destroying Matheson's original concept . I suppose movie studio's can justify themselves by the need to make a profit at the box office but there's other flaws that are impossible to tackle First of all there's the lack of dialogue . Respected reviewers on this site including Bob The Moo have praised the first half of the movie with the isolation of Neville's lonely life as he drives through an empty New York but a story needs character interaction and a protagonist needs someone to talk to and the dialogue light , slow deliberate pace becomes very boring after a while and it's not helped by the lack of a soundtrack . Danny Boyle was much more effective with his dead London scenes in 28 DAY LATER There is a character for Neville to talk to but it's not actually a human character - it's a dog . You know as soon as the dog is introduced it won't be seeing the end credits and so lack lustre screenwriter Akiva Goldsman mawkishly manipulates the audience in to feeling sorry for Fido when he becomes infected and has to be killed . It's so predictable certain audience members will have to stifle a yawn rather than reach for a tissue to dry their eyesEven those people who have praised the first half have criticised the second half where we have characters who are introduced out of the blue . There's a lack of logic to this . The characters are aware that there's a sanctuary somewhere so why didn't these characters make a beeline for the sanctuary instead of sitting around hoping to get a radio message from Neville ? You'd think they were clairvoyants , either that or Goldsman is a rather insipid screenwriter The other problem of the second half is when the infected / mutants / vampires are introduced . There is not one scene as far as I recall where the infected are never anything more than laughably bad CGI effects . It's ridiculous that this film supposedly cost $150 million and the director couldn't employ a few dozen extras in make up . Really if was a " walk on artiste " I would be angry about the use of CGI seen here I AM LEGEND is a near impossible story to adapt but the producers should have at least tried to focus on what type of audience the film was produced for . It's not really a film does the book justice , nor is it one that will really appeal to fans of the post apocalyptic genre . There's also a distinct lack of action and tension and dare I say much entertainment . Despite its many flaws THE OMEGA MAN is a very entertaining movie and much superior to this remake
Love It Or Hate It Indie Art House Flick	Maths genius Max Cohen finds himself being pressured by a a corporate gang who want to make profits on the stock market and a bunch of kabbala Jews who want to contact god There that's the premise of PI . One that on the surface seems both entertaining and slightly bizarre , but I have to warn you that this is one of the most bizarre movies I've seen in a long time , try and imagine David Lynch on acid and you may just start to understand how strange this movie is . Did I use the word " Understand " in this review ? Believe me that word will be coming up frequently since I couldn't understand the plot at all , that's right this reviewer has the courage to admit that he doesn't understand maths , he doesn't understand kabbalistic dogma , or that doesn't understand what maths has got to do with the stock market since it's run by market forces not mathematical equations . I also didn't understand the scenes with Max stabbing a brain with a pencil or what he was doing sitting on a park bench at the end since he drove a power drill through his head in the penultimate scene . If any of the above sounds so crazy you want to watch it because of the craziness factor be warned because much of the running time is taken up with Max sitting in front of a computer doing equations . That's right a man sitting in front of a computer same as you're doing right now as I sit in a computer typing up this review . Can there be anything as tedious or as unexciting or as uncinematic as watching someone in front of a computer ? The only scene of PI that elicts any type of excitement is when Max is saved from the corporate bad guys by the kabbalistic bad guys but apart from that the rest of PI revolves mainly around Max tapping away at his keyboard doing maths Perhaps because of the dry subject matter director Darren Aronofsky does make the movie as bizarre as possible but it's nightmarish rather than involving , disturbing rather than entertaining , hateful rather than admirable with the cinematography , editing and musical score making this a very memorable piece of indie art house if for not all the wrong reasons then certainly not for all the right reasons - I've watched a great number of horror movies and very few of them have freaked me out as much as PI . Though if you look at the trivia section on this page you'll see that the production has a few interesting stories behind it so credit where it's due . But it still remains a movie that will be hated by a mainstream audience
I'm Guilty	Seeing as THE JUROR revolves round a plot of someone trying to convince a jury to find a man accused of murder innocent I was expecting something along the lines of 12 ANGRY MEN and you do not believe how foolish I feel writing this paragraph . I wish to throw myself at the mercy of anyone reading this and beg their forgiveness . I do have slightly mitigating circumstances - The trailers on TV for THE JUROR actually did give the impression that it was going to a tense court room drama , but seeing as Demi Moore was the star this is no excuse . After all a tense court room drama would have needed a good script and some intense acting , neither of which can be found in a film containing the words " Starring Demi Moore " What's that you're saying ? You're ready to cut me a deal if I offer some information ? Well here goes . . . It's not a court room drama at all , it's a very dumb thriller and tries to hide its dumbness by twisting and turning as it goes along which just becomes ridiculous . It starts in a bedroom in America and ends in some temple in the jungle somewhere . Oh and there's some twisted romance sub plot too . Just think this could have been quite good if the producers had decided to focus on the heroine trying to get her fellow jurors onto her side in an open and shut case , and it goes without saying there's a massive cop out where the script decides to forgo any explanation why the jury changed their mind about the accused . It's the producers you want to cross examine not me
" I'll Give You Anything You Want " . . .	. . . Is the opening line of this movie with the reply being " Do we look like criminals ? " , but I wish the reply had been " A bigger budget please " because OUTTA TIME would certainly have benefited from it . The story while being no great shakes is engaging enough with twists and turns holding the interest but it's impossible not to notice the cheap sets , the mediocre cast and the very shaky ( I mean that in its literal sense ) directing that you'd expect to find in a straight to video movie
Running On Empty	CARRY ON MATRON was released in 1972 and it's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like CLEO , UP THE KYBER and SCREAMING being from the mid to late 60s In itself MATRON is by no means bad it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot ( A bunch of spivs trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of contraceptive pills which they plan to sell to third world countries ) surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though unsophisticated nature . I think that's where the problem lies - The gags aren't all that amusing with the unsophisticated nature starting to show its age . Did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot ? Perhaps the worst criticism I can make is that I saw CARRY ON MATRON this afternoon , less that twelve hours ago and I have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line . That's a serious problem for a comedy
A Major Disappointment	You'd think black romantic comedy + Robert De Niro + Ben Stiller = great fun wouldn't you ? But MEET THE PARENTS is an extremely disappointing film . Some of my disappointment might be down to the trailers I'd seen ( Which basically contain all the amusing moments ) which led me to believe I'd be seeing a film similar to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY . Okay there's a couple of bad taste moments and there's a subplot involving a cat but there's nothing I found to be laugh outloud funny . De Niro - Like in WE ' RE NO ANGELS - seems to think comedy involves entirely of mugging for the camera , it's sad to point this out but De Niro is doing himself no favours by appearing in all these films , a few more unfunny comedies like this and Travis Bickle will be a distant memory . And as another reviewer pointed out watching this film after September 11th 2001 makes it even more unfunnyUpdate 2005 : Having recently rewatched this movie I wish to point out that is does slightly improve over time
Not Depressing Or Disturbing But Oh So Pretentious	IN THE TIME OF ANGELS starts with a voice-over of a young woman lamenting the passing of time . This strikes a chord with the human psyche and can be summed up with Matt Johnson's song Another Boy Drowning . It's a topic that while being cathartic can also be unredeemable depressing . Luckily the rest of this short film isn't depressing but unluckily this doesn't make it very good . For much of the running time a pretty young woman sits at one end of a table looking at the other end where a demonic vision is seated rather like a segment from BEAUTY AND THE BEAST . It's disturbing at first but then the whole short film becomes irritating as it drowns in its own self importance and pretentious overtones as the audience has to endure animation , special effects and ghostly dancers . I find it impossible to communicate to you dear reader as to what the story is about or if it's about anything as this viewer was subjected to a barrage of meaningless abstract images . Some people might see this as " art " but I much prefer narrative to art
Post Modernism In The 1940s ! ! !	What shocked me about THE ROAD TO MOROCCO is the self referential post modernism , ie the characters know they're in a film . Bob and Bing sing a song about meeting Dorothy Lamour while later Bing turns to Bob and says " Hey if we were tied up how did we get out of the sacks ? " to which Bob replies " If I told you they'd < The audience > know too " and later on a camel ( And I'm not making this up ) turns to the camera and says " This is the loopiest movie I ever did see " . I didn't actually know that people in the 1940s went in for a post modernist approach and had always believed it was a 1960s thing . One other thing that shook me was the portrayal of Arabs which I doubt would be allowed in these PC times , it's a very strange experience seeing a comedy at the expense of stereotypical Arabs It's a pity no one is allowed to poke fun at ethnic groups nowadays because I would have liked to have seen Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson in THE ROAD TO KABUL where our two heroes get involved in a Talebunnie wedding . What's a Talebunnie Theo ? A Talebunnie is a member of the regime that used to rule Afghanistan untill a couple of years ago when an American led coalition intervened in the country and the Talebunnies hopped away like frightened rabbits Boing Boing Boing Don't bomb us Mister coalition airforce . We were only obeying the will of Allah Boing Boing Boing
I Agree With Most Of The Critics	As always the problem of getting someone to play Muhammed Ali is that they don't have the charisma to play the great man , hell not even Ali could play himself convincingly in THE GREATEST so I didn't think Will Smith star of weak Summer blockbusters like WILD WILD WEST or the MIB films was going to be much cop in the title roleI do think Michael Mann is a good director and is rather underrated due to the fact he started out in television . Mann does bring realism to the fight scenes in ALI , they're maybe not as good as the ones in RAGING BULL but they still pack a punch ( Sorry couldn't resist that one ) , compare the ring scenes here to the laughably bad ones seen in the ROCKY movies and you'll notice a big difference . My only criticism of Mann in this film is that a few of the scenes outside the ring lack narritive drive with one of the characters saying something to another character and having the camer a linger too long on the characters moody look , but this is a minor flawThe serious flaw is something everyone else has pointed out and is something that I quickly noticed while watching ALI - The script is too overlong . I hadn't read the readers comments untill I sat down to write this review so my views weren't prejudiced but most of the reviewers are spot on , fight scenes feature as do politics , religion , Malcolm X , government spooks and Ali's marital life and I can't help thinking the whole film would have worked better if it had just focussed on Ali's boxing career . As it is ALI isn't a film I'd watch over and over again like RAGING BULLIt does have a positive point in its favour - The cast . If I hadn't known what part Jon Voight was playing I'd have sat through the film wondering when he was going to turn up because he's totally unrecognisable but he's very good in his role . Ron Silver is almost unrecognisable but good as is Mario Van Peebles , but best of all is Will Smith as Muhammed Ali . Okay I could nit pick but that would be unkind and pedantic so all I'll say is Smith deserved his Oscar nod
Doesn't Go Far Enough	You want to know about rabies ? Try this : One time I was abroad and was unfortunate to be bitten by a stray cat . I didn't think too much of it at the time . I traveled back to the capital city to catch my plane back to Britain and I got into a conversation with the night porter at my hostel who had spent his national service as a medic and for some strange reason the conversation got round to rabies . " We don't have much of that here in cities , but there's a lot of it in the north of the country . Very terrible death , I'd much rather die of AIDS or cancer " he told me . Considering I'd just returned from the north of the country I felt the first pangs of worry . The porter then went into detail of footage he'd seen while in the medical corps " You can see in the victim's eyes that they're aware of what's going on despite their delusions . . . the throat contracts in spasms and that's what kills them , they effectively suffocate . Very nasty death " By now I was having a panic attack and didn't actually care if I got blown up by a terrorist bomb on my way back to the airport Before I left the next day I popped into a cybercafe and looked up cases of rabies in the region . What I saw terrified me since the disease isn't exactly unknown where I was , several people had died there in the late 1990s . I then looked up symptoms of rabies on the internet and the night porter wasn't kidding , it's almost certainly the most terrible death known to mankind , it kills 40-50 , 000 people a year and worst of all even if you're receiving inoculations against the disease if you develop symptoms that's it - You're almost certainly going to suffer a lingering painful death . Few and far between are survivors of rabies and those who do survive are left with terrible brain damage making them little more than vegetablesAs soon as I arrived back to in Britain I felt slightly dizzy and had a sore throat . I might have been the first symptoms of rabies or more likely it might have been the cold virus . I popped into my local health centre where I had an appointment with my doctor " Any foaming at the mouth ? If you'd been exposed to rabies you'd have contracted it by now " which is incorrect since it can take as much as several years for symptoms to develop though the average incubation is two to three months , I'd been bitten a couple of weeks earlier . The doctor ( Who seemed much better at asking questions rather than answering them ) managed to contact a hospital in Glasgow where I went the next day . I love hospitals . Having all those young nurses fussing over you , so normally if a young , tall , slim , blond nurse took my blood pressure I'd be in flirting heaven but not this time . I let the nurse carry out the tests without any wise cracks . I was then seen by the doctor , she was in her early twenties , brunette , perhaps the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen , I vaguely noticed she was bra less and it was a very cold December day . No cheeky comments , no flirting and most of all no false machismo to impress this definitive vision of beauty . To give you an impression of how serious I was after I'd had the first course of vaccinations , I thanked her and said " I hope to never see you again " and I meant it . The hospital sent the vaccine to my local hospital where I was successfully inoculated against the virus over a course of a month . I'm alive but for several weeks I couldn't even begin to describe the fear I felt . I couldn't even hear the word " Rabies " without breaking into a cold sweat . It was perhaps the most frightening experience of my life That's the problem with THE MAD DEATH - It doesn't go far enough . I do remember the title sequence but alas I also remember a few unintentional funny scenes . A woman smuggles in her pet from the continent and it ends up on the menu for a fox which then attacks the star of UFO . If I remember correctly the most " shocking " scene involves Basil Brush being covered in shaving foam being slammed against Commander Stryker's car windscreen . Oh and Commander Stryker's been a naughty boy since he's been having an affair with his secetary and has given the rabies virus to her : Cut to Ms Secetary lying on a hospital bed dying of rabies . It looked like she was faking an orgasm while vomiting toothpaste ! You do get the impression that no one on the production has seen a rabies victim die . There's other images that stick out in the mind like the army going on a cull or the final ambiguous scene that implies it's all going to happen again but comes across as being cheesy . If you really want to know about this terrible killer disease , go abroad and get bitten by a stray mammal then type in " Symptoms of rabies " in any search engine . Make sure you have plenty of toilet paper ready because you'll certainly need it
Cinematography Doesn't Equal A Great Film	Director Janusz Kaminski is best known as being Spielberg's favourite cinematographer and has won cinematography Oscars for SCHINDLER'S LIST and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN . This no doubt explains why in Kaminski's LOST SOULS the cinematography seems to be the most important aspect of the production . Things like narrative drive , performances etc seem to have been sacrificed in order to bring moody , atmospheric sepia stained cinematography to the screen . I will give Kaminski some credit because he has made a brooding film even though audience members might spend the first third scratching their head asking themselves where this is all heading , and the editing is very good with a very impressive scene where street lights reflect upon Peter Kelson's car windshield as he drives under them Like nearly every single horror movie ever made it's the gaps in logic that lets the film down . Maya Larkin washes her hands in a public toilet , hears a sound behind her and calls out if anyone is there . Duh , it's a public toilet and members of the public use public toilets so why should Maya be concerned that someone might be in a cubicle ? It's almost like the character knows she's in a horror movie . Likewise why should the audience be concerned that Peter Kelson has a rude Jewish woman as a neighbour ? If he had a polite easy going Jewish neighbour I think that would be something out of the ordinary ! And the movie is full of these scenes that are somewhat bizarre where common sense prevails , I mean a bunch of priests being allowed to turn up at an insane asylum in order to carry out an exorcism ! Credible when you think about it ? I don't think so There's also two additional problems with the movie , neither of which have anything to do Kaminski . First off is you're reminded of other movies that feature Satan in all his forms and alas some of them like THE OMEN are far better than this but it's no better or worse than END OF DAYS either . Secondly much of the premise revolves around how seriously the audience can swallow the idea of Satan coming to Earth . Nigel Kneale used this plot in a brilliantly inventive way in QUATERMASS AND THE PIT but the concept used here is laughable if you're an atheist or the satanic equivalent of one and hence the film lacks credibility
Very Over Directed and Disappointing Over All	IMPOSTER is based on a short story by Philip K Dick whose stories have been used for the rather underrated TOTAL RECALL and the rather overrated BLADE RUNNER amongst others so hopefully we'd have if not a classic movie then a memorable and thought provoking one . And the story does get off to a good start as Earth is attacked by a superior alien civilisation ala STARSHIP TROOPERS or SPACE ABOVE AND BEYOND . While Earth wages a war for its survival scientist Spencer Olham is arrested and interrogated as being a suspected traitor working for the other side and we've got got all the makings of a very good sci-fi psychological drama Oh dear , this is not how IMPOSTOR works out at all because the story soon turns into a sci-fi version of THE FUGITIVE with Spencer Olham on the run from his interrogator who looks far too much like George Michael for my liking . At least none of the action takes place in a LA public toilet and for what have could have been a very involving , intelligent story we're left with a runaround plot that we've seen far too often before Yeah the screenwriter Stuart Rosenberg should carry much of the blame but it's the directing style of Gary Fleder that spoils much of the movie . For a start he has the failings of a lot of directors in making the future look too futuristic and compare this to Paul Verhoeven and TOTAL RECALL where the director brings so much more on screen credibility by having the characters wear clothes and using technology that a present day audience can connect to . It should also be pointed out Fleder seems to have been inspired by Michael Bay since he uses a ridiculous amount of cross cuts and slo mo filming techniques many of which seem to have been used simply because it seemed like a good idea at the time So what had the potential to have been a good movie is ruined by the screenwriter and director . The ending was not what I expected but even then this isn't a good thing because it leads to a rather large plot hole . I do wish movie producers would treat fans of this genre with a bit more respect
Slow Burning Bore	The plot to GUINEVERE is as follows : Harper Sloane a young woman aged twenty embarks on a sexual relationship with photographer Con Fitzpatrick a man old enough to be her father There that's the entire plot summed up in a few words . Notice how the plot is cogently summed up in a few words ? This means the story is rather threadbare and not much happens . The unlikely duo do things together like attend parties , have sex and take photos mainly of Harper's naked adolescent body but even this isn't exciting as it sounds and is in no way intended to be an " erotic " tale if you know what I mean Looking through the comments on GUINEVERE it seems opinion is very much split as to what the audience makes of this movie . Some people enjoyed it as a character study while others think it's a ridiculous movie . To be fair Stephen Rea and Sarah Polley do make the most of their slightly bland roles and the music is haunting and a line of dialogue " You will have a twelve inch cck up your ass very soon " did make me giggle but that says more about me than the quality of this movie
Doesn't Work	The best type of television cop is the fascist but fair cop . Jack Regan from THE SWEENEY and Frank Burnside from THE BILL are the personification of the fascist but fair cops as seen on British television , yes they beat confessions out of guilty men and occasionally blow away a bad guy but the bad guys were guilty in the first place so that makes it all right . THE BILL started to lose its impact after Burnside left the series and the show suffered from much lower ratings because of it , hell Burnside was THE BILL so the producers kept bringing him back every now and again . And being a sometimes avid watcher of THE BILL I was looking forward to seeing this " gritty " spin off show but felt it was a complete waste of time afterwardsThis series is called BURNSIDE but is a complete misnomer . It consists of six episodes of three 2 part stories but if you're expecting them to revolve around Fascist Frank you will be in for a major disappointment since only the first story centres around him , the other two centre around his colleagues the very attractive Sam Philips who is far too pretty to be a convincing policewoman and Dave Summers who is a gay black policeman . Yup a gay black policeman and never once does Burnside come out with the obvious line " Don''t stand behind me you iron " . Not only that but for both of the latter two stories Burnside is off screen for much of the time , compare this with the amount of BILL episodes where he's the focus of the story . And despite the post watershed screening time and the very occasional use of the " F " word by the villains there's nothing memorable about the episodes and could have easily been written for any British television detective showAny chance we'll be seeing Frank back in THE BILL after this debacle ?
Cold War Drama That Left Me Cold	THE RUSSIA HOUSE is a very well acted film with a good though electic cast . Connery is fairly good in his role but he could have played the part with a little more laid back attitude , Pfeiffer is great as is Klaus Marie Brandauer but whose idea was it to cast Ken Russell and Martin Clunes ? The problem I had with THE RUSSIA HOUSE is that John Le Carre novels are not a good source material for films , they're far too literary with lots of scenes of characters discussing espionage strategy and the human condition and this is no different . There's too much talk , too much philosophy and not enough action . I remember this film was marketed as a thriller on its release when it's nothing of the sort - it's a drama . Bare this in mind and you may not be too disappointed while watching it
Very Pretentious And Disappointing If You've Read The Book	I read Whitley Striber's novel THE WOLFEN in the early 1980s and though not being much of a horror fan was mildly impressed with it and found out a couple of years later that a movie version starring Albert Finney had been released and I tried to find the movie on video but with no luck and it was several years later until I saw WOLFEN when it was broadcast on channel 4 one night and I was disappointed with it Director Michael Wardleigh directed the classic Hippy concert movie WOODSTOCK and this adaptation has " Hippy anti corporate giant eco warrior " written all over it . In the book the wolfen are Darwian in concept - Nature is cruel so the wolfen are cruel . This is ignored for the most part in the film which often descends into smacking the audience around the head as to what a terrible thing industrialized societies are . Remember how conservationists and environmentalists put red Indians on a pedestal in the 1960s and 70s ? Well much of the narrative centres around mystic legends of the Native American Indians . Very noble sentiments I'm sure but much of this doesn't really go anywhere . Neither does the subplot about possible eco terrorists being involved in the murder of a powerful capitalist and his wife . We know who killed them at the start of the movie so why drag up people opposed to corporate economics into the story ? Strangely enough this might help WOLFEN become a sort of cult classic amongst anti globalisation protesters but for a mainstream audience who were expecting a horror film it's a turn off and what really spoils the movie is the ridiculous ending where we're told that it's all the fault of the human race and the Wolfen are really the good guys only protecting themselves from humanity . Sounds like this movie contributed to the movie career of Steven Segal . Reason enough to dislike it To be fair to Wardleigh he has managed to capture some of the atmosphere and gore of Strieber's novel . One scene I recall from the book is something that doesn't appear in the film version per se is where a detective investigating the case is killed and when the paramedics pick up his body he spills in half ! Nasty . In the movie the nearest equivalent is when a detective has his hand bitten off and then his head - Which is lying on the pavement trying to say something . The director also manages to make New York come across as a cold , impersonal bleak place and when Wardleigh does this he succeeds . It's just a pity he didn't concentrate on these aspects more rather than cramming new age thinking and Indian legends down the audience throats
Has Dated Poorly	If there was ever a movie whose dated production values let down its very effective premise THE LOST PATROL is it . Philip McDonald's story of a British Army patrol being picked off one by one by Arabs in 1917 Mesopotiamia is compelling enough and no doubt works very well on the written page but this 1934 adaptation has dated very badly . I am trying to be very forgiving , something that other people on this page have tried but something I personally am not very good at The main bugbear is the acting . In those days actors were used to acting on stage which is entirely different from film acting where the camera picks up on every little nuance and _ expression which greatly exaggerates what the actor is trying to convey . Watching THE LOST PATROL in 2006 means you're stuck by how hammy everything is . Again I'm trying to be forgiving but I can understand people falling out laughing if they were to watch this . Karloff especially comes off as being far too over the top , even though inevitably you could make the same criticism of nearly any other religious fanatic seen in cinema with perhaps the only notable exception being piper Laurie in CARRIE . Despite being Oscar nominated I did find Max Stiener's score very intrusive adding even more irritation to the unsubtle aspects of the movieWhere the film does work is in the characterisation . All too often in movies the military characters are just cyphers there to spout lines and despite some criticisms of how the parts are played you do believe that these guys are a very good cross section of the British army in 1917 . And of course all the tension centres around on who gets killed off next , a bit like TEN LITTLE INDIANS set in the desert A flawed film whose dated qualities stop far short of it being called a classic . Despite this there's enough bare bones for it to be a contender for a remake . Think about it . Mesopotiamia is now in present day Iraq and we could see a film where a British patrol of 1917 finds itself cut off from reinforcements by Sunni nationalists as they describe a cruel and ruthless enemy without the story becoming consciously post modernist
Good Start Ruined By Commercial Interests	On the surface this is basically an action adventure movie featuring a load of Americans with guns , but it gets off to a very powerful start as a former Korean war hero finds that his son who has been captured by Vietnamese forces in 1972 hasn't been returned home . This is very touching helped in no small measure by Gene Hackman's acting and James Horner's score . You really do feel for this character as he gets shunted to pillar to post and as he gets ripped off by South East Asian scam merchants . This movie is well on its way to being a powerful human drama dealing with the grief caused by war Alas . . . . . . after the first ten minutes the producers decide that powerful human drama is for a bunch of pansy assed liberals give their characters a load of weapons and send them off to the ' Nam to rescue their captured comrades and more importantly to slaughter lots and lots of goddamned commies . It's very strange to watch this movie play out since the start does show that the production team posses some talent on pulling the audiences heart strings but decide to go ahead with making a movie that contains lots of gun fire and explosions thereby appealing to a large unthinking audience . It's also extremely dumb in places where Hackman's character manages to get some acid head biker out of prison just like that or where characters survive spectacular copter crashes I gave UNCOMMON VALOR and if it wasn't for the moving opening ten minutes it would probably have got a lot less
A Bit Too Dated And Melodramatic	It's now impossible to mention cinema featuring junkies without speaking of TRAINSPOTTING the cult Brit flick from the mid 1990s . Before Danny Boyle's film came along I guess people thought of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM when they spoke of the abstract misery of drug addiction Obviously you can't compare the two since rules of what you can feature on screen have changed over the decades , but it's impossible not to notice how dated this movie is . First of all it's painfully obvious that Otto Preminger has shot the entire film inside a studio , the myriad of scenes where people walk along unconvincing studio sidewalks makes the movie feel like a cheap film noir B movie and the very melodramatic plot twists ( Believe me you'll know what I'm talking about when you see them ) reinforce this feeling . I also have a problem that it's never suggested that Frankie Machine brought all these troubles to his own doorstep by volunteering to become a drug addict , something that TRAINSPOTTING blatantly mentions . How can a junkie be a victim of anything when they volunteered to become an addict ? But lets not be too negative and cynical since we are talking about 1950s cinema . Frank Sinatra does manage to make Frankie Machine a not unlikable anti hero while Elmer Bernstein's big band score is memorable . It's just that THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM comes across as rather twee and dated in the twenty first century
As I Expected	I've never been all that keen on comic strips , the only exception being the strips that appeared in the issues of the Doctor Who Weekly by Marvel comics from over 20 years ago that featured early work from legends like Dave Gibbons , Paul Nearey and Alan Moore , but apart from that I have no interest in what some people pretentiously describe as " Graphic novels " . Come to think of it shouldn't books be called " literary comics " in that case ? No ? Well thank gawd for thatMy knowledge of the X-Men strip exactly matches my interest ie zero , so I was surprised when the movie's opening sequence takes place in a Nazi death camp which led me to think this topic didn't belong in this movie , but as the story progresses this ties in with the subtext of the movie . Unfortunately this subtext of xenophobia is quickly forgotten about as the movie mutates ( Geddit ? ) into a yawn stifilling battle between good and evil , the only difference being that both the goodies and baddies have superhuman powers . It goes without saying that there's a lot of make up and special effects involved and both are disappointing especially the CGI . It's also obvious that before X-MEN was shot it was going to be a franchise movie which means we have a fair amount of exposition which holds up the storyX-MEN is just as I expected it to be for the most part , a Summer blockbuster heavy on FX and light on plotting and characterisation . It's not the worst Summer blockbuster you'll ever see but just like a comic strip it lacks substance
Got To Disagree	You know what to expect with a CARRY ON film : A repertory of comedy actors , nudge nudge wink wink humour involving double entrendes and a few laughs too . Unfortunately I've got to disagree with most of the comments here and say I don't rate CARRY ON HENRY as one of the better films in the series and after the very funny caption " Mind my chopper " ( Which absolutely no one outside Britain will get ) the laughs are few and far between as the plot revolves around King Henry and his marital troubles . It should be pointed out that all the best CARRY ON films like Up The Kyber , Screaming and Cleo had been made before this which probably indicates the series had run out of steam
One Serious Production Flaw	THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD is credited as being the very first cold war analogy science fiction movie . This is summed up by Scotty's radio broadcast at the end of the movie where he states that a handful of brave Americans have saved the day and to " Watch the skies " . What he really means that only Americans should be trusted to save the world and to watch out for communist infiltrators . Hardly one of screendom's most subtle messages With such an obvious subtext about fighting communism the producers have gone and shot themselves in the foot by missing out on such an obvious aspect of John W Campbell's source novel WHO GOES THERE ? and it's this : The alien creature is a shape shifting monster and can take the form of human beings . Worked it out ? The alien could resemble friends , family members and work colleagues just like communist agents would resemble friends , family members and work colleagues . For a movie that is trying to warn us about the red menace I am somewhat shocked that the producers didn't work this element into the screenplay at the very first draft . As many people have mentioned on these pages THE THING hasn't dated well , but my dad saw it when it was originally released in the cinema all those years ago and he didn't think much of it then , so I doubt if the passing of time has much to do with it not being all that regarded in the 21st century . It should be pointed out that a story featuring a plot of a monster walking about killing people wasn't all that original in 1951 anyway since Universial Studios had been making this type of movie almost 20 years earlier via FRANKENSTIEN , THE WOLF MAN etc and in those movies the audience did feel empathy for the monster unlike here . Though I guess if the monster is a filthy commie we're not supposed to empathise with itDespite some reservations ( The massive plot holes for example ) I do prefer the John Carpenter remake which stays closer to the original novel , a novel that ironically doesn't have a political subtext despite the shape shifting elements
Will Certainly Appeal To Abstract Nature Lovers	I've always been slightly surprised by the popularity of nature documentaries , it seems to be the new soccer . You go into a really rough pub that makes Al Swearengen's place in DEADWOOD look like a tea room and hear from the toughest hardest men in there how much they've been enjoying the National Geographic channel . I always keep silent that I much prefer the History channel over National Geographic . Perhaps the reason so many people enjoy these documentaries is because the skill and manipulative nature of the docu film makers makes these films what they are DEEP BLUE lives up to its name . The water is unbelievably blue as we see dolphins leap out of the ocean in slow motion . Sorry to break this to people but dolphins can and do jump out of the water , but only in real time and never in slo mo . We see a massed army of crabs running around the sands and through some clever editing and sound effects it appears they're having a game of soccer . The music used matches the mood perfectly graceful music is used for graceful animals like dolphins , menacing music is used for sharks and humorous music is used for the penguins You see the point I'm making ? It's a manipulative beautiful documentary featuring animals that the film makers have humanised and will appeal to the more urbane and abstract nature loves amongst the human race . If I sound cynical perhaps it's because the day after I saw this I took a dip in the Atlantic Ocean where I had to dodge aggressive jellyfish and hungry gulls who were very interested in my picnic . I eventually got home with sunburn on my back and blisters on my feet . Nature is a thing of great beauty but it can be painfully cruel too
Bizarre Enough To Remain Watchable	Oh what a strange film PERFORMANCE is . It often gets praised to the high heavens but much of this praise is unworthy . It certainly deserves its reputation as a strange avant gard movie but believe me it's no masterpiece . James Fox plays London gangster Chas and it's a hoot seeing Fox trying to play some tough working class cockney bloke . No doubt Michael Caine was written with the role in mind but decided he didn't fancy the location filming in rainy old London town . Certainly Fox fails to convince as a tough guy but this adds some much needed watchability to the proceedings The best thing about PERFORMANCE is the portrayal of old school London gangsters . The movie was actually shot in 1968 but wasn't released until 1970 and one can't help thinking the trial and subsequent jailing of the Kray firm might have had something to do with the delay . I mean it's obvious the gangsters seen here are a bunch of violent homosexuals who stay stay in bed all day lusting over pictures of gay porn and it's obvious they're based on Ronnie and Reggie Kray . One can't help believing that if the Krays were found not guilty of the murders of McVitie and Cornell in 1969 this movie's release would have been delayed even longer After a torture scene so camp you'd think it was filmed at a trailer park ( " Oh you like this you twerp " ) Chas finds himself taking on the identity of a juggler and staying at a safe house owned by a rock star played by Mick Jagger and it's at this point the film loses much of its entertainment value because Mick Jagger can't even play Mick Jagger convincingly and the vague story becomes static A lot of people consider PERFORMANCE to be some sort of masterpiece but to be honest it's a slightly irritating art house movie with some crazy editing technique . Much of its reputation is built upon its homo-erotic air which no doubt shocked audiences at the time but seems pretentious and a little tame nowadays . Perhaps the only thing a mainstream British audience will notice about it now is that actor Billy Murray looks far older as a 27 year old than he does as a 60 something in 2006
Turn Your Brain Off And You Might Enjoy It	Ah yes the French foreign legion , something every schoolboy with a sense of adventure has thought about joining , and something film makers have dedicated a lot of celluloid to . Jean Claude Van Damme made a previous film set against the background of the legion : AWOL ( Aka LIONHEART ) but this is far superior . In fact AWOL and LEGIONNAIRE are complete opposites since one has Van Damme running away from the regiment to become a prize fighter while the other has Van Damme as a prize fighter who runs off to join the legion ! But like I said LEGIONNAIRE is the better film . It's enjoyable in a very cliched way , and I mean very very cliched , no cliche is left unturned but at least we don't see Van Damme strip off his shirt and engage the Arab hordes in fisticuffsIf you liked MARCH OR DIE you'll like this movie
This Is A True Story . . .	. . . Except that the Eden Pedecaris character was in reality a man who didn't have any children with him and that the battle at the end with the United States Marine Corp defeating a German force never happened . So in truth it's not actually a true story plot wise It's very arrogant of Hollywood in general and John Milius in particular to re-write history in this manner because the film is rather accurate in some other ways namely the portrayal of Theodore Roosevelt . Want to know about how the teddy bear came into being ? Watch this film . Roosevelt was a great lover of nature , he was both a hunter and an ecologist and decided that if America wanted to be a major world power then the nation would have to carry a big stick while speaking in a soft voice Roosevelt more than any president in history made America the superpower it is today and it's a very topical film to watch in 2004 . America's resentment of Germany and France ! Arabs slaughtering infidels on the battlefield but taking a moral high ground about women and children being held as hostage ! American military leaders and diplomats not really caring if they start a bloody war ! The more things change the more they stay the same It is interesting to see that Milius has painted the Arabs with very human faces . Mulay might be a brigand but he's a most likable anti hero and a cinema audience has the rare opportunity of seeing what Sean Connery is capable of when he's given a good role . I wonder though how this film would have the Arabs if it'd have been made a few years later after the Iranian revolution ? I've got a feeling it would never have been made at all in todays current climate As it stands THE WIND AND THE LION is very poor history in most parts , fairly good history in some parts and stands as a sort of timepiece when Hollywood was far less xenophobic than it is today
A Subtext In Need Of A Better Film	When someone mentions the phrase " anti war film " it sums up many images . Perhaps it may involve good Germans doing their duty for the nation state which has been hijacked by genocidal maniacs and both CROSS OF IRON and DAS BOOT spring instantly to mind . It may involve teenage GIs fighting and dying in the jungles of South East Asia . We all have our favourite anti war films . Indeed my own favourite film of all time is APOCALYPSE NOW while my all time favourite documentary is Morgan Matthews 2008 gut wrenching , heartbreaking tribute to the British war dead from the war on terror THE FALLEN . HEROES is another anti war film featuring the aftermath of the Kargil war between India and Pakistan . The problem is that it's a Bollywood movie which means we're subjected to shoehorning song and dance numbers between the poignant moments Actually I'm lying slightly because there are no poignant moments . There are clichéd moments , stilted moments and just plain boring moments . In fact it's impossible to understand what the point of the film is : war is hell ? Thanks we all knew that already but the story is impossible to take seriously . We see a Sihk being interviewed on TV where he makes a rambling speech about the good old days when emperors and kings would face each other man to man ( Hmmm wouldn't that be a court martial offence ? ) A airforce pilot in a wheelchair ( No don't ask how he was crippled for life because it's never revealed ) and worst of all the story revolves around a couple of conchie pacifist students who after delivering death letters to the families of the bereaved become patriots of the motherland with the greatest of respect for the nation's fighting man . None of this is ever convincing in any shape or form There is one thing that makes HEROES watchable and that is the music and choreography . Fair enough , like a great many of other Bollywood movies the singing and dancing can be very hit and miss and this film is no different Some of the musical numbers don't work but when they do such as the show stopping Makhana number they work very well . Such a pity the song and dance jar with the very serious subtext of young men dying in battle and of the grief this leaves behind
Slightly Strange Sequel	! ! ! ! ! POSSIBLE SPOILER ! ! ! ! ! There's two possible reasons you can criticise BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES for . First of all by playing it safe and have Brent go through the same sort of plot that happened to Taylor in the first movie then ( Second possible criticism ) have the film mutate ( Geddit ? ) into something rather different from the first half of the story . I don't know if it's just me but the second half of this film has an entirely different feel from the rest of the franchise . It's by no means abad thing because I really did enjoy this bleak downbeat twist of amutant kamikaze karioke singalong , though no doubt a lot of reviewersseem to hate it . I actually saw this at the cinema a few months before PLANET OF THE APES premiered on British television which meant I my enjoyment of the shock ending of the original was spoiled slightly . Let that be a warning to you - Never watch a film franchise out of order . And never EVER let mutant humans write hymns !
Sequelitis	If THE TEMPLE OF DOOM suffers from anything then it suffers from a condition called " Sequelitis " . It's a condition that is in no way serious but does show that in order to infect the host ( Aka the cinema audience ) the carrier ( Aka Mr Hollywood producer ) gets into a stupor of not doing anything , instead the carrier takes all the best ideas of an earlier movie and gives the host more of the same . In effect we have a movie that does not dare be different and why should it if the previous clone made the carrier a fortune at the box office . And to be fair THE TEMPLE OF DOOM is exciting and funny in parts . The problem is if you didn't like RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you won't love this movieI've always thought Spielberg was overrated and when this movie was released he was regarded in some quarters as the greatest director of all time - A laughable assumption . The film contains some impressive set pieces but they would have been more impressive if the director had bothered to do a bit of trimming like the cart chase which goes on for too long . This especially becomes obvious when we're treated ( Though I doubt if " treated " is the correct word ) of a close up of Kate Capshaw screaming into the camera . This over the top humour reminded me of Spielberg's 1941 which is a very good example of spectacular humour not working . I should also point out that with the exception of JAWS I have always found John Williams to b a very average composer , and if some people consider this 1984 offering to be by " the greatest director of all time " then why was I unimpressed by the cinematography ? It should also be mentioned that if you were upset by the amount of violence in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK you'll also be upset by the amount of violence here but that's to be expected since this movie suffers from sequelitis
Like Most Franchise Movies It Lacks Substance	The problem I had about trailers in the late 1990s is that they seemed to show all the best bits of movies and LW4 is a great example where either Sgt Murtaugh is running around in his underwear clucking like a chicken or Sgt Riggs is zooming up the freeway hanging on for dear life . These two set pieces are memorable but they're also the best bits of the movie Okay the LETHAL WEAPON series was produced merely tom entertain but by the fourth instalment things have become rather stale . After the good opening sequence with Tank Man we're treated to another amusing action packed set piece but you find yourself laughing at it and not with it " Oh my god where's the shark ? " He seems to have disappeared or has turned into a giant rubber fin . Perhaps the producers should have spent less on napalm and invested on better model work ? We also have to wade through the characters domestic lives which if this is supposed to be character development doesn't convince and also interferes with the pace of the movie and you often find yourself forgetting that there's a plot involving ruthless triadsAs for the cast you do feel that both Gibson and Glover are getting a bit bored by the routine but Chris Rock is bearable simply because he has the best lines with the scene where he reads out a felon's rights " If you can't afford an attorney then . . . " having me laughing out loud . One thing I hope LW4 won't be remembered for is that it's the last screen role for Joe Pesci who has appeared in some of the greatest American films of the last 25 years . Despite being entertaining no one can call this a great film
Like Everyone Else Has Said	A power blackout sweeps across America leading to fear which slowly manifests itself into suspicion : Who will you be able to trust if the lights don't come back on ? That's the idea behind THE TRIGGER EFFECT , a film that on the surface resembles the plot of a novel by John Wyndham or John Christopher but as so very , very many people on this page have screamed from the roof tops this isn't a movie that makes the best of a great idea The film starts with a sequence that can best be described as " Robert Altman directing the opening shot of SUPERMAN 3 " which is meant as a compliment to Robert Koepp . as the story continues we're quickly introduced to the characters of Matthew and Annie Kay who have a baby . They're visited by their friend Joe and then disaster strikes when the electricity runs out and shows no signs of returning . Get ready for danger On second thoughts don't get ready for danger . There's something about this scenario that I can't quite pout my finger on . Maybe it's to do with the scenario which is credible but the actions of the characters aren't . Would a long lasting power cut lead to the collapse of civilization as we know it ? Possibly since everyone went on a looting rampage during the New York blackout of the late 1970s and let us not forget the mass panic caused by reports of rapes , murders and other assorted evil after Hurricane Katrina but even so I was not convinced that a power cut would lead to a post apocalypse scenario , it's not like the population has been rendered blind by a meteorite shower ( DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS ) or a worldwide famine is in progress ( THE DEATH OF GRASS ) or a nuclear war has happened ( Insert your most depressing Nuclear holocaust movie here ) . Perhaps I should point out that THE TRIGGER EFFECT probably isn't a post apocalypse type movie so if you're expecting 28 DAYS LATER you're in for a rude awakening , this is more of a slow burning drama where characters seem to be making mountains out of mole hills . By trying to be realistic it ends up being unrealistic . I'm sure most people would nonchantley sit on their behinds in this type of situation rather glad that their quarterly electricity bill would lower than usual . Hell the police are still driving around arresting people during a blackout , do you understand what I'm saying about a lack of credibility ? I have criticised the characters but to be honest I think the problem lies with Koepp's casting more than his writing . I found Kyle Maclachlan rather wimpy as Matthew . I guess the point was that adversity can lead to wimps turning into violent anti-heroes but I was never convinced by his performance while the rest of the cast failed to make any type of impression on me at all All in all this is a very disappointing contribution to speculative fiction . Let me just repeat that I doubt if it's intended to be an out and out grim depressing story of man fighting to survive , it's more of a drama about how reliant we are on both electricity and each other but the story never reaches its full potential which is a great shame
Not Really The Film You've Read About	This is a rather obscure film that is rarely shown on television . Interestingly if THE LEATHER BOYS does turn up on television it usually is described as " A newly married bridegroom becomes besotted with a charismatic homosexual " which isn't really explaining the plot properly and also misses out on an important subtext . The subtext is that people we bond with aren't the people we think they really are The story revolves around recently married Reggie who has a 16 year old bride called Dot and unfortunately Reggie is starting to realise that married life isn't as he expected it and starts to hang around with a young free and single biker called Pete . It's this young free and single attitude that attracts Colin to Pete . Throughout the running time the narrative hints subtly that Pete may be gay - Dudley Sutton doesn't play Pete in a camp way either - but it's only revealed for certain that he is when Reggie waits for Pete in a closet gay bar with the optimism that they're both going to emigrate to America . As it turns out via Pete's gay associates in the bar that the boat they're supposed to be catching is bound to Liverpool , not America as Pete had promised . Cut to a devastated , disillusioned and depressed Reggie walking off into the sunset , still young enough to start a new life but with no one to start a new life with THE LEATHER BOYS is one of those films that may have seemed controversial at the time but probably wasn't . There's no overt sexuality on screen and you do notice in the final scenes how homosexuals are portrayed in a camp stereotypical manner so it's maybe a film that gays won't like due to dated stereotypes and many straights won't like because they're misled as to it being a gay love story ala BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN . It's the sort of British kitchen sink storyline that would be better suited to something like CORONATION STREET
Despite The Do-Gooder Agenda A Searing Example Of Injustice	! ! ! ! SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THE CASE ! ! ! ! Forget the examples of " Innocent " Irishman from republican ghettoes who just happened to be visiting England during IRA bombing campaigns during the mid 1970s and being " falsely accussed of crimes they didn't commit " . The most glaring example of injustice is the case of Derek Bentley and Christopher Craig . Bentley and Craig were caught breaking into a warehouse in the 1950s . 19 year old Bentley was arrested by the police on the scene . Minutes later 16 year old Craig shot a policeman dead . Guess who the state hung for the murder of the cop ? That's right the 19 year old who was already in police custody and had nothing to do with the shootingI repeat this is the greatest injustice ever carried out by an English court , a great wrong that can never be put right was carried out . However I do have a problem with LET HIM HAVE IT and that is in the portrayal of Christopher Craig . Poor Christopher , poor poor Christopher who shot a policeman was really a victim of the system . He grew up in poverty , he was surrounded by criminals , guns were easy to access , all those Hollywood movies put ideas into young Christopher's head and tradgedy of tragedies Christopher's big brother was arrested by the old bill and sentenced to a long prison term . Poor unfortunate Christopher , what chance did he have in life ? or at least that's what the film seems to be trying to tell us . It also insinuates that he actually shot the policeman ( Whose name I've forgotten - You do get the impression only Bentley and Craig are the victims here ) by accident . And there's an incident that goes against all the other accounts I've read on the case - The scene where Craig " falls " off the roof . I've read elsewhere from several sources that Craig shouted " Give my love to < His girlfriend > " and jumped . Instead we see a revenge filled Fairfax growling at Craig with the heavy hint that the criminal was thrown off the roof by the detective . There's one other thing that bothered me about the events in this account . There's a lot of sympathy for both Bentley and Craig ( perhaps too much sympathy for the latter ) so why did the film show the most controversial aspect of that fateful night ? This is where Bentley screams " Let him have it Chris " , hence the title . Over the years Craig is on record as saying that Bentley had said no such thing and that the police had lied and despite what he'd done in the past there's absolutely no motive whatsoever for Craig to keep up this pretence . It's almost certain the police at the trial lied under oath by saying Bentley somehow encouraged Craig . Of course in those days lawyers , judges and most especially juries believed what the police would tell them and it's strange that a film with cynical 1990s sensibilities seems to take what the police said on that night as gospel truth . In many ways it jars with the bleeding heart attitude that makes up the rest of the film . Flaws aside I'll give the film its due . The director has picked a very good cast with Brit vets Tom Courtenay and Tom Bell adding experience to the two newbie stars of the film : Paul Reynolds who unfortunately seems to have disappeared and Christopher Eccleston who's great here and is great in everything else he's done which gives hope to even the most disillusioned DOCTOR WHO fan So watch the film and decide for yourself what you think about the death penalty . Bare in mind that there were two victims that night and neither of them were Christopher Craig
Very Low Brow But I Liked It	Duece Bigalow cleans fish tanks for a living and by a contrived set of circumstances finds himself looking after the home of male gigolo Antoine Laconte who is very house proud and a bit of a psycho . What's the odds of Laconte coming home to find his house a bit of a mess ? There you go a very simple predictable premise featuring someone who's got a rude sounding name . I lost count of how many times people mispronounced the name " Laconte " but I will be honest in saying I did like some aspects to this film no matter how predictable and unlikely they were : " Hey Deuce it's Antoine . If I come back to find out there's any mess I will kill you " . I also liked the not so unsubtle references to THE MATRIX and American GIGOLO Of course I can understand why some people don't like it . It's a very unsophisticated movie that feels like it's trying to be a Farrelly brothers comedy but failing and even I became very fed up with the cop showing Deuce his thingy in every scene they appeared in together along with the running gag about sea snails , but come on it's a low brow comedy and I knew before I sat down to watch it that it wasn't an Oscar contender . Try FREDDY GOT FINGERED or GET OVER IT if you want to see a really bad comedySix out of Ten
Not As Good As I Remembered	I first saw this movie in the mid 1970s and didn't think much of it possibly down to the fact that the much hyped exploding octopus didn't make an on screen appearance . I then saw it again in 1982 when I was a teenager and vaguely remembered enjoying it as highly entertaining camp nonsense so when I read it was going to be broadcast on channel 4 I set my video recorder in order to tape it but after viewing BATMAN I did feel some pangs of disappointment The plot is stupid of course and the production values are relatively poor but surely that's part of the appeal of the original TV series isn't it ? I think what has happened is that memories have been slightly mutated into believing that this film version of BATMAN is some sort of sophisticated camp post modernist master work when in fact it's far from self referential . The classic scene of Batman running around with a bomb doesn't feature the title character addressing the audience - When he says " Some days you can't get rid of a bomb " he is actually talking to himself and no one else least of all the audience . Likewise the sententious statements on the sanctity of all life , good people , bad people , fluffy animals and the noble porpoise seem sickly sweet by accident rather than by design Despite the disappointment BATMAN remains very undemanding rather silly entertainment and should be congratulated in its unpretentious nature unlike the franchise that was started by Tim Burton in 1989
It's Confused And Dated	I can remember much of the 1980s and would have remembered much more if I didn't insist on drinking too much at that time . I remember it as the decade of of political ideologies clashing in the third world , of political boycotts of the Olympics and the threat of the cold war turning into a very hot conflict called World War Three which absolutely terrified me at the time . Strangely Oliver Stone thinks the worst thing of the decade was yuppie culture Charlie Sheen ( Straight from his star turn from PLATOON ) plays Bud Fox the hero of the story who seeing that Gordon Gekko wants to buy and asset strip his father's aircraft company goes out of his way to bring down the Gekko empire This is where I got confused . Bud comes from a blue collar background and pulled himself up by the bootlaces to get where he is , he's done this through a capitalist economic system that will see him richer beyond his wildest dreams . In a slightly different manner he's very similar to Gekko who under slightly different circumstances has also got where he has through the capitalist free market system , so what is it that Stone is attacking ? There's a contradiction here somewhere . I guess because Gekko is " greedy " it's this what makes him out as the bad guy ? It's because young Bud knew hard times and still has a conscience about blue collar workers and their jobs that he's the good guy ? Is that what Stone is saying ? By a bitter and unconscious irony on the part of Stone you could say that the all reaching corporate greed of Gekko is a metaphor for Reaganomics while the protect the jobs of American blue collar workers at all costs ideals of Bud is almost identical to the ideas of Pat Buchanan . Is Stone praising Buchananite philosophy ? You see the point I'm making about a confused message ? WALL STREET is also rather dated watching it now . Check out those hairstyles . No wonder there's a hole in the ozone layer with the amount of hairspray in the movie . The soundtrack by Stewart Copeland is also very sterile and mechanical like much of 1980s music . There's also several funny scenes where Gekko takes phone calls on his mobile phone where he has to fiddle about with the antenna at the top and hold it with both hands since in those days mobile phones resembled two house bricks glued togetherDespite my criticisms WALL STREET isn't a bad movie . Charlie Sheen is every bit as good here as he was in PLATOON ( Though these are probably the only two movies where he gives very good performances ) while Michael Douglas is superb as the amoral Gordon Gekko , and Terence Stamp and Martin Sheen are always worth watching , and considering the movie mainly revolves around a bunch of people in offices making as much money as they can the story is compelling in parts
Not Really Twice The Fun	I'm in two minds about this Stan & Ollie short . While it's far less episodic than some of their other stuff like THICKER THAN WATER - And watching these shorts many many years after I last saw them I found their episodic feel is a major problem to today's audience - it's not all that funny compared to most of their other stuff mainly due to nothing ultra sadistic happening . I've always thought the best films in the series are ones when something really nasty happens to Ollie while Stan just stands there with a vacant glazed look upon his face . One other point I didn't like was the irritating voice over given to Ollie's wife who's played by Stan
Suffers From Its Political Viewpoint	THE WAR GAME comes with a heavy reputation and was shown for the very first time on British television in 1985 , twenty years after it was first filmed - and banned - by the BBC . As a docu-drama it carries a punch perhaps not a strong a punch as THREADS but still a killer knockout punch with deeply disturbing imagesThe problem though is the polemical view that Watkins takes . People are asked about retaliation in the event of a nuclear strike , retaliation being the whole point of deterance - something Watkins fails to point out , and about strontuim 90 , a question that seems offensive in its smugness when people give the wrong answer . Oh and Watkins bashes the Church too , very radical I must say . Christian CND - never heard of itSo all in all deeply disturbing stuff spoiled slightly by Watkins patronizing attitude that never allows the viewers to think for themselves . Very much better than THE DAY AFTER , not as good as THREADS
Good Enough Character Driven Story But With Several Serious Flaws	It's painfully obvious that Russell T Davies produced Who doesn't start reaching its stride until late in the season and he continues the trend here . It's also obvious that he's more than capable of writing a good opening hook and a good ending but what comes inbetween is extremely variable . Turn Left continues the trend also Perhaps the biggest difference between old style Who and its successor is how the classic series was driven by plot while NuWho is character driven . Both styles have their fans and detractors but unfortunately RTD often exploits character while diminishing plotting . The premise of Turn Left revolves around the Doctor never having met Donna Noble in The Runaway Bride and of him dying during that story ad the fall-out that goes with it both literally and metaphorically . It's a very good idea and RTD is great at ideas but unfortunately his plotting is flawed Think about itfor a minute . If the Doctor had died in The Runaway Bride then we'd have seen the witches succeed in The Shakespeare Code and the Daleks complete their plans in the season three Dalek story not to mention the Master taking over planet Earth . In other words Donna's world if not universe would be entirely different from the scenario seen here . RTD is using selective continuity to suit himself . This borders on cheating Talking of continuity leads to other irritants . I don't like obsessive continuity because it's what led to the show being postponed in the mid 1980s when we'd see old foes returning , anorakish references being made left right and centre which panders to the lowest common denominator of the fanbase whilst alienating more mainstream viewers . I do rate Billie Piper as being a talented actress but doubt if she's doing herself any favours by returning to the show . Can anyone seriously think of her as not being Rose Tyler any longer ? On the subject of continuity what is the point of bringing back UNIT if it's nothing like the organisation introduced in the 1968 story The Invasion ? UNIT doesn't even stand for United Nations Intelligence Taskforce - it's now become Unified Intelligence Taskforce and is composed of fat blokes and other minority groups . I bet Douglas Camfield is turning in his grave In short Turn Left is a fair enough story that shows the flexibility of DOCTOR WHO but after seeing it you are left with the impression that the show is running dangerously low on empty from RTD and that the season finale had better be something special
Heavy Handed Anti-War Film	First of all I feel I've got to point out the two flaws of ACES HIGH1 ) The film starts with the commonly held erroneous view that young men of whatever nation joined the army because they'd been brainwashed by glorious tales of derring do and had no idea of the horror awaiting them in the trenches . Not so in Britain at least since The Times newspaper published the names of every British serviceman killed at this time . One edition in July 1916 published over 20 , 000 names of the men killed during the Somme offensive , so to insinuate that the boys at the school had somehow only had Gresham's account of the war to fall back on is somewhat naive . This might have happened in 1915 but not so when this film was set towards the end of 1916 2 ) ACES HIGH is based on the play JOURNEYS END except it revolves around a plane squadron which means when the chaps are at the airfield everything feels a bit too stagey while when they're up in the air there's a distinct lack of drama since the cast are indistinguishble with their goggle clad faces and their lack of dialogue Having pointed out the flaws I can't not mention the main strength and that's the cast . Malcolm McDowell an actor I can't usually stand at the best of times gives a superb performance as the bitter , cynical alcholic John Gresham . It'd be very easy for McDowell to give a very over the top performance ( Some might say that's all he ever does ) but he's both very convincing and disciplined here . Christopher Plummer is completely convincing as a paternal English officer ( Plummer was always good at this kind of role ) and Peter Firth - Despite being hampered with a character unsubtley written - is also good Considering the limited budget the technical aspects are impressive enough with the sometimes slightly obvious backscreen projection hardly bringing the film down . It's an anti-war film so its heart is in the right place but like many an anti-war film it's somewhat heavy handed ( As I imagine the source play was ) and the ariel scenes with their lack of dialogue means a somewhat over dramatic film in places and an undramatic film in other
A Film That Cheats The Memory	I had very good memories of this 1970s Disney classic ( The early 70s being when the rot really set in for the studio ) and sat down to happily watch it again this afternoon . I did find a serious problem with the first half and that was the yawn inducing character introduction and a plot that goes more or less nowhere . Things did pick up slightly with a song and dance number featuring Sihks , Jocks and a Jamaican steel band but the movie felt like an inferior remake of MARY POPPINS , something that wasn't helped by the casting of David Tomlinson and everyone trying to emulate a Dick Van Dyke inspired cockney accent . At this point I seriously began to question if I'd got BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS mixed up with another movieThen about two thirds of the way through the movie takes off in a spectacular manner where the characters finally make a trip to " The bottom of the beautiful briney sea " where they meet animated characters and take part in a football match . They then go back to Britain in 1940 and use magic to hold back a dastardly German invasion . The final third of the movie is superb entertainment and this bitter cynical critic was totally enthralled by this part and knew right away why I enjoyed this movie as a child But I have to repeat that it's the much latter part of the film that makes BEDKNOBS AND BROOMSTICKS so memorable and unfortunately tricks people into thinking that it's a better film than it actually is since the first hour or so is very disappointing and slow . It's not so much the memory that's cheated - It's the film itself that's cheated the memoryHaving said that even the sub standard parts are far better than anything JK Rowling could be capable of writing
A Good Film In Parts But One With Serious Flaws	Some reviewers point out that when you remember a movie from several years ago your memory blocks out all the bad things leaving only good memories of it . I mainly disagree with this view point . With the exception of some DOCTOR WHO stories everything I remember , either good or bad , about a film or TV show from yesteryear seems to be confirmed when seeing it today . There are exceptions to this and one of them is SCARFACEI first saw this in the early 1990s and can vividly remember the performances , dialogue and gut wrenching violence . I saw it a second time a few days ago which did confirm that my memory of great performances and dialogue had been correct . However I'd seem to have forgotten all about serious flaws the film has First is the rather annoying operatic feel of the movie , everything is grandiose and over the top . Every set is massive as the camera pans out showing us the sets . People don't just take a line of cocaine , they fall face down in a massive mound of the drug . People don't fall down after being killed , they almost explode in a sea of red stuff while the final climatic shoot out becomes laughably OTT The second flaw is Tony Montana's motivation . He cares about children deeply ( It's this that leads to his downfall ) but nothing in Oliver Stone's script explains why he's so caring about little ones . It's an obvious redemption plot . He cares . End . No explanation . It's never really explained either why Tony wants to keep his sister away from all menAs I said SCARFACE does have some really good points . I never once thought I was watching Pacino act because Pacino IS Montana and all the other performances are good . Despite the flaws of the script the dialogue is highly quotable with lines like " I bet you aint been fed all year " and " Say hello to my little friend " . A shame the gut wrenching violence is too overblown to be credible or disturbing . A good film but I can't help thinking at the end of the day CARLITO'S WAY is a much better movie
Had potential	Plotwise OCTOPUSSY had the potential as being one of the very best Bond films , the idea of a rogue Soviet general exploding a hidden nuclear bomb inside a NATO base in order to win the cold war is something out of the very best Frederick Forsyth novel , but why oh why did the producers decide to ruin this almost credible and clever idea by having the plot jump from location to location in a completely superflous manner and add so many silly scenes ? Director John Glen is regarded as the weakest director in the series and watching OCTOPUSSY ( Or any of his bond films ) it's easy to see why , Roger Moore hangs off a mode of transport in a close up that fails to disguise the fact that he's in a studio doing the scene against back projection , then the director cuts to a long shot showing a stuntman hanging from a real mode of transport on location , which fools absolutely no one . Glen uses this unconvincing technique several times in every Bond film he has made
You're Reading Too Much Into It	I think people reviewing this film are getting too hung up on subtext , so what if Andrei Konchalovsky was born in the USSR ? he also made the pretty dire TANGO AND CASH and I fail to see how anyone can interpret that as a dig on the Stalinist system , so to compare RUNAWAY TRAIN with the complete works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn seems slightly insulting . On its own merits RUNAWAY TRAIN is an unlikely story but watchable enough because of Eric Roberts and Jon Voight's performances neither of whom decide to let the word subtle stand in their way , and that's what makes their performances so watchable
Depends On What You Think A Curse Is	THE CURSE OF THE OMEN is not without interest . It revolves around the supposed curse of Richard Donner's 1976 movie THE OMEN . Bad things happened before during and after the production . However many of the bad things that happened can surely be put down to coincidence and many of these terrible things have a tenuous connection with the movie For example we're told how stuntman Terry Walsh was standing in for Gregory Peck in the graveyard scene where the character Robert Thorn is attacked by a pack of rottweilers . Apparently they injured Walsh quite badly when they bit through his protective clothing . But as any stuntman will tell you the most dangerous stunts always revolve around animals because they have a mind of their own and their behaviour is impossible to predict . I should also point out that I'm a DOCTOR WHO fan and Walsh appeared in a great number of walk on parts in the BBC show and I've read several interviews on his career and seeing THE CURSE OF THE OMEN was the first time I'd heard about this incident . Perhaps the incident with the devil dogs has been exaggerated ? The documentary also mentioned another stuntman who worked on THE OMEN and was later seriously injured while filming A BRIDGE TOO FAR in Holland . Easily explained when you realise that stunt men do a dangerous job . I'm sure that everyone who worked on THE OMEN injured themselves some time or another The vagueness as to what this " curse " might be is also brought into question when Richard Donner explains the hotel he was staying in London was bombed by the IRA and that no matter what the weather was like he would always check under his car to make sure terrorists hadn't left a nasty surprise for him . This is common sense since the IRA were engaged in a sustained bombing campaign of London in 1974-75 , but it should be pointed out that if THE OMEN was filmed in 1973 or 1977 or had been filmed in another city the production team wouldn't have been subjected to terrorist bombings . Whose fault was it the hotel got bombed ? Is it the fault of a movie or the fault of a terrorist cell ? There is another incident that would have been laughably tenuous it if wasn't so tragic . Remember that scene in the movie where a character's head is sliced off by a truck with sheets of glass ? Well the effects artist behind that sequence John Richardson was driving in Holland when he was involved in a car crash and his travelling companion was " cut almost in half and died instantly " the insinuation being that it was like the scene from the film and most chilling of all it happened near to the town of Ommen ( sic ) ! Again it happened during the production of A BRIDGE TOO FAR . Perhaps that film is jinxed ? Strangely enough I was surprised that no one mentioned the decapitation scene was set in Megiddo in Israel a place that saw a bus bombing that murdered 17 people in June 2002 with heads and limbs scattered all over a road . Do you understand what I'm talking about when I mention shoehorning ? Coincidentally the word Armageddon is derived from the place name Megiddo . Again I'm surprised this wasn't mentioned To be fair Richard Donner himself dismisses these and other incidents as merely coincidence and categorically states that he doesn't believe in curses and regardless of whether they believe in curses or not fans of the film will find this interesting since it goes into depth about the anecdotes behind the making of the film including one about the famous scene with the goldfish . It's certainly a thought provoking documentary and would make a great companion piece to the movie
A Warning To Us All	Steve and Robert do the night shift in a 24 hour store in the year 2057 and right away I had this mapped out as a self referential post modernist Sci-Fi story down to the reason that the first words to come out of the characters mouths are to do with these old science fiction movies and how modern everything would look in the future where everyone would drive around in cars that could fly and where people would wear plastic clothes and I can distinctly remember as a child looking forward to the year 1999 when you would be able to get a job on Moonbase Alpha with Commander Koneig . I digress . That's not how the story pans out though and I found myself slightly puzzled as to why it had to be set in the future because the story would have been equally engaging and successful if set in the present day Bob has mentioned that he has the feeling that writer / director Celia Galan Julve knows what they're talking about and that's my distinct impression too . ONE MINUTE PAST MIDNIGHT isn't a Sci-Fi story at all - It's a very human story about fear for the future . Will someone he spends their nights awake be able to go back to the routine of functioning during the day and sleeping all night ? Perhaps the most poignant and recognisable subtext is having regrets not on what we've done but what we didn't do . This short also boasts a very impress score that almost had me on my feet dancing too
Moody , Atmospheric But Far From A Masterpiece	! ! ! ! ! MILD SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! There's a lot to commend M Night Shyamalan's SIGNS for . It's not often we see such a moody atmospheric thriller about an alien invasion and I will praise this movie later . However Shyamalan shots himself in the foot by the way the story is told Crop circles appear outside the home of the Hess family and after Graham Hess and his brother Merril find out that it wasn't caused by local pranksters Graham's son Morgan comes up with the answer - It was done by aliens . He knows this because he read a book on the subject . Obviously everyone else in the world has read only one book - The same one as Morgan - because as soon as crop circles appear round the world it's the leading story and can mean only one thing : The aliens are coming . And sure enough just like everyone has predicted lights appear over Planet Earth's cities which herald the start of little green men come to wipe us out If someone told you crop circles were signs on an alien invasion how would you react ? Exactly but at no point does anyone question a possible invasion because it's taken as read by all the characters in the story which starts to become ridiculous when the world's broadcasters start interrupting programmes showing the world wide phenomenon of crop circles . Let's be honest here jet liners crashing into sky scrapers is a good reason to interrupt TV shows with 24 hour news reports but people finding crop circles all over the world is not There's one other thing : Ten year old Morgan seems to be channeling the minds of Newton , Darwin and Einstien . Listen to this kid's dialogue " Everything people have written about in science books is about to change " and there's several more instances of this . You can't take this child seriously or believe in him as a three dimensional character Make that two things : Why would aliens invade a planet whose surface is composed of 70 % water ? Isn't the human body two thirds water anyway . Oh and how does Graham's neighbour know that the aliens don't like water anyway ? Better make that three things because if the subtext is about rediscovering ones faith then why is everyone certain of an approaching invasion ? Surely for this theme to work then Graham should have been shouting from the roof tops that aliens don't exist only to be proved wrong . If he's wrong about aliens then surely he's wrong about the non existence of the lord right ? It's a great pity that Shyamalan didn't think these things through a bit further because despite not ruining the movie these things stop SIGNS becoming a masterpiece of genre cinema which it certainly had the potential to be . Even a critical viewer like myself who noticed the flaws couldn't help being terrified by the climax in the cellar where for one heart stopping moment it looked like a couple of the characters had been abducted . As for the scene Graham sees the reflection in the TV . . . . I certainly can't fault the good bits and I will recommend this movie even to those who don't like SF / Horror very much . Certainly it's a radical change to watch a film like this that doesn't have tens of millions spent on special effects and the film works better for it . You reading this Mr Spielberg ? Shyamalan will best be remembered for THE SIXTH SENSE , a film that I found somewhat overrated while his follow up UNBREAKABLE was a masterpiece in my opinion . SIGNS is slightly different because it doesn't have one of those shock twist endings and when you consider what a poor film THE VILLAGE is one can't help thinking that Shyamalan would be better off abandoning clever endings and concentrating on terrifying audiences and I would wonder if he could get away with directing a Hollywood version of Nigel Kneale's QUATERMASS AND THE PIT . Now that would be worth queuing at the cinema forUpdate 30 dec : Some have mentioned that the concept of predestination is very important to understanding the movie ie the plot holes aren't actually plot holes viewed this way and while this makes absolute sense in a metaphysical way it still misses out on logic
Not A Racist Film	Watching this film in a PC era like today you may find allegations of racism being made against it , but you have to remember that 55 DAYS AT PEKING was made in 1963 . The war in the Pacific had ended less than 20 years earlier and the horrors of the Burma railway and the Bataan death march were still fresh in the memory . Likewise the UN had fought a dirty and bloody war against North Korea and Communist China ten years earlier and 1963 was a year when America started committing ground troops to South Vietnam , so this was an era where many people were worried about " the yellow peril " . One thing you can't really accuse the film of being is geo-nationalist , a coalition featuring diverse nations like Germany , Russia , Italy and France fighting alongside Britain and America ! You can tell this was made a long time ago and if it was made today the Americans would have saved the day single handed while portraying everyone else as total cowards . At least the makers of 55 DAYS AT PEKING had the decency of showing a factual historical event without having to totally rewrite history . I do hope present day Hollywood producers will take note . My only problem with this film is that the main story is held up with a romantic subplot featuring Charlton Heston who's not exactly romantic material , but this is soon forgiven when the battle scenes arrive and what battle scenes they are . Watching these scenes today I was struck as to how they were achieved by a combination of stuntmen and stuffed dummies . That's what I hate about modern day blockbusters that rely on cartoonish CGI figures running around . It's a lot more fun seeing a couple of man sized dolls falling a couple of hundred feet with dubbed screams on the soundtrack , Hollywood doesn't seem to do this type of action sequence anymore which is a great pity
This Movie Is 100 % Crazy	MACKENNA'S GOLD has got to be one of the craziest movies I've ever seen . Watching this I was very worried that someone had spiked my local water supply with LSD The opening title sequence alone sets off warning bells with the music being very similar to a sixties spy shows like THE MAN FROM UNCLE . After the bizarre title sequence comes an even more bizarre opening scene featuring an expositional voice over complete with a corny song called " Turkey Buzzard " . Structure wise this is somewhat similar to the opening of NO BLADE OF GRASS released a year later but in terms of execution it resembles THE DUKES OF HAZZARD . " Well lookee here if it ain't Boss Hogg come to get his hands on Apache gold " . This voice over keeps appearing when you least expect it to . As the film moves on to the story proper more and more ridiculous things take centre stage . People have already mentioned the choppy editing like the bridge sequence and the river scene , but throughout the movie we see characters in one scene only for them to appear in a following scene which does seem to interfere with the time frame , and there's some very jarring cuts from studio exteriors to location filming which is laughable , not to mention the long shots of characters riding on horses which cut to actors bouncing up and down on an imaginary horse against back projectionThere's also a subplot about half way through where a load of characters are introduced who want to find a legendary valley of lost gold . Many of these characters are played by big name actors ( They don't come much bigger than Edward G Robinson ) which led me to shriek " Hey I know where this is heading . They're all going to slit each others throats to get the gold " . Logically a film should play out like this but you'll never see a film less logical than MACKENNA'S GOLD because most of these characters are written out in the next scene . I've no idea why the producers did this or why they decided to cast so many big names for something that accounts for one cameo sequence . The fact this movie cost seven million dollars ( A big budget for a movie in those days ) and has very poor production values makes me believe most of the money was spent on the cameo performances . Talking of production values why has no one mentioned the outrageous and sidesplitting revealing mistake of the stuffed dummy falling off the cliff ? The climax takes place in a valley of gold and again there's very little logic involved . The hero Mackenna doesn't want any part in it so decides to escape after he arrives there . If that's the case then why has he spent the whole movie telling everyone he doesn't know where the valley is ? Did he know where it was or doesn't he ? And if he knows where it is but didn't want to show the bad guys the location what was stopping him from waiting till everyone was asleep and running off ? As everyone else seems to have noticed the last twenty minutes of the movie seem to have been inspired by if not mystical mumbo jumbo then at least by illegal substancesProduction wise MACKENNA'S GOLD is an awful film , but I couldn't help but enjoy it . it's a turkey for sure but it's a turkey buzzard that earns for entertainment value
Intelligent And Complex . Perhaps Too Much So !	This is an early Bond movie that is very intelligent and complex . After being defeated by Bond in DR NO , the criminal organisation SPECTRE devise a plan to bump off Bond while at the same time humiliating the British and Soviet intelligence agencies . The " problem " with this Bond film is that because it is so complex and intelligent it never really feels like a Bond film . Viewed beside DR NO and GOLDFINGER it never feels like it belongs in the same series and while it's certainly better than THUNDERBALL it's never as much fun as YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE due to the sensible premise See it's the premise . Bond is never really given much to do , he's to meet a Soviet defector who has got her hands on a decipher machine and they've to meet a British agent on a train . At no point does anything ridiculously spectacular happen and you often think this is a story written by John Le Carre or a sequel to NORTH BY NORTHWEST . Oh don't get me wrong FRWL is much better than most of the Bond movies from the 1970s and 80s , it just never feels like a Bond film despite the appearance of a mad lesbian woman with strange footwear
The Irony Is Enjoyable	Say what you like about the Bond franchise ( And in my opinion I don't have a lot of good things to say ) but the series never came out with the old cliche of having those nasty pinko commies as the bad guys . Bond's enemies where always the fictional SPECTRE or mad scientist types , not that this was always successful of course . But I did enjoy the ironic fact that this new Bond starts his first filmed mission with an attack on a secret USSR base . Even better in this respect is the title sequence where we see the demise of communist icons and as the story progresses we find out the bad guys are ex-communists turned quasi mafia , and the motivation of the main baddie involves a cold war betrayal . All this gives GOLDENEYE a sense of time and place , something that can't be said for most - If any - Bond films . GOLDENEYE is a very good Bond film even if it's not up to classics like DR NO or GOLDFINGER . The production values are certainly a million times better than what we saw in the 80s . Brosnan is fairly good but lacks that serious touch that Dalton and Connery had . The only other complaint I have is that tank sequence which is very silly and interferes with the pace of the film . The one thing that puzzled me though is the main villain . He's played by an actor far too young to have born in the 1940s . I know Anthony Hopkins was to have been originally cast in this role but if that was the case would he have been required to have a really brutal punch up with Bond at the climax ?
A Good Series , But Ten Episodes ?	In the mid 1980s The Vietnam War was very much a part of pop culture . Movie like PLATOON , FULL METAL JACKET and HAMBURGER HILL were making money at the cinema while book stores were full of publications dealing with accounts of the conflict and there was even a top five hit in the British pop charts by a singer called Stan Ridgeway who sang about his life being saved in ' Nam by a marine called Camouflage . What a lot of people ( at least in Britain ) had forgotten if they even knew was that Australia had also fought in the conflict and this mini series tells the story of one family's warVietnam was shown on BBC1 in the summer of 1988 with not much fanfare , but what wasn't mentioned was that two episodes would be edited into one . This certainly a good idea on the part of the BBC down to the simple reason that the early episodes are very , very slow as they introduce us to the characters of the Goddard family . The father is a politician in the Aussie government while the son gets drafted into the army while the daughter becomes a teenage rebel , and somewhat embarrassing to say it now but I couldn't help thinking that despite being a fairly good actress the Goddard daughter was one of the plainest looking girls I'd ever seen in an Australian series . The name of this actress ? Nicole Kidman . I digressAs I said the first two episodes ( Or first episode if you saw it in Britain ) crawls along at a snails pace and the series doesn't come into its own until the action switches to Vietnam . This show doesn't sugar coat the face of war : Vietnamese women are tortured and raped by the American army , young Goddard is seconded to an American special forces team and watches as prisoners are tossed out of a helicopter AFTER they've told the Americans what they've wanted to know , a villager is executed in public by the VC after refusing to hand over all the food supplies , but the most memorable and distressing scene features an Aussie conscript who stands on a mine . It's a special sort of mine that doesn't explode until after the victim takes his foot off it so the soldier has to stay there under the blazing jungle sun till he can take it no more , panics and dies . I notice some people who have voted at this page ( Most especially the regular voters ) haven't been too impressed by Vietnam . The structure is rather uneven with a very slow beginning and the final episode ( s ) does hit you over the head that the war split Australian society but I can't help thinking the rather lukewarm response by some voters here has more to do with the fact they were expecting large battle scenes as in PLATOON and APOCALYPSE NOW . This is a foolish attitude since the Australians fought the conflict in a different way way from the Americans . Australia being experienced in anti guerrilla campaigns in Malaya and Borneo recognised the fact that this wasn't a conventional war therefore fought the war by sending small patrols into the villiages and jungles and went out of their way not to antagonise the inhabitants , a stark contrast to how the Americans conducted the war Thanks to the internet there's now a large database of information of the Australian experience during the Vietnam conflict . It makes interesting reading
Entertaining Study Of Marxist Ideals	It's no secret but Sergio Leone was a supporter of Marxism . All his work has a socialist ideal running through it and A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE is the most obvious example . Look at the opening sequence as Rod Stieger's is given a lift on the bourgeois coach . Oh what decadent pigs they are , the imperilist American , the priest spreading his opiate through the land , the arrogant philistines who look down their noses at the proletarian passenger who they view as a worthless parasite , but most of the all the sexually repressed woman who takes great joy in discussing her sexual conclusions of what these peasants get up to when the lights are turned off at night , I bet she has a few dark secrets . Of course you just know that revolutionary karma is on its way I have to honest and say that despite recognising the philosophy of Leone I've never been much of a fan of his work , his films tend to be overblown and obvious with sometimes totally silly scenes and with the exception of ONCE UPON A TIME IN America none of them can be classed as masterworks of cinema but A FISTFUL OF DYNAMITE ( Who decided to call it DUCK YOU SUCKER ? ) is better than most even if it suffers from the directors usual faults in that it's over long and we get too many close ups . I really do wonder if Leone viewed editors as decadent reactionaries What makes this movie better than most of Leone's movies is that the story while not exactly being groundbreaking is thoughtful and involving . A revolutionary comes across an IRA fugitive and enlists his help to overthrow the government . At least unlike American movies this Italian effort doesn't go out of it's way to make the noble misunderstood Irish bombmaker the focus of the story , he's there as a catalyst / plot device more than anything . Despite not having the most convincing Irish accent James Coburn does seem to have been hired as something more than as a hunky , macho action IRA hero unlike Richard Gere in THE JACKAL and Brad Pitt in THE DEVIL'S OWN . Rod Steiger is fairly convincing as the peasant revolutionary and it's rather scary that this is perhaps one of his last notable performances . The use of humour is genuinely amusing rather than silly and the movie contains a very memorable soundtrack . Come on I bet you were calling " SEAN SEAN SEAN " after seeing this Apart from calling for socialist utopia the subtext of the movie features guilt and redemption with Sean's flash back sub story to the fore but I've always thought the most moving and intelligent part of the subtext is when a former revolutionary tells of the time when he was tortured into informing by the state " I thought I would never break under torture but I did . Nothing can be changed . The dead will remain dead . What am I supposed to do ? Kill myself ? I can still be of use to the cause " which is a fairly unique thing in a film since nearly all informers in movies don't need to be tortured in order to give out info while no one seems to feel any guilt at sticking in their former friends to their enemies
Sleazy Fun	The only thing I didn't like about EARTHQUAKE was the fake blood superimposed on the camera lens during the elevator scene . Apart from that I liked the rest of the film and positively loved some of it . What sets EARTHQUAKE apart from other disaster pics is its hard edged sleaziness . We have Sgt Jody of the national guard . He hates " Freaks " but must be the only man in LA not to realise he's the biggest freak in town , and he is one of the most memorable characters in the disaster genre . Yes sir . And the film features one of the most bitchy laments seen on film : " Mr Cameron pulled me out of the elevator then I heard all the screaming " " It must have been the only time that old b done someone a favour " And add to all this some really nasty , cruel and spectacular deaths and you've got a film worth watching . Mindless entertainment at its very best
Entertaining Comedy Thriller	I knew TAXI was a French film with a screenplay by Luc Besson but that was all I knew about it . I speculated that since it was written by Besson we'd be seeing a very violent thriller but that's not what TAXI turned out to be since it's an entertaining comedy Pizza delivery boy Daniel Morales drives his own unlicensed taxi and one day makes the mistake of driving ( In his own illegal manner ) Emilien to his place of work which is bad news for Daniel because Emilien is a police inspector . Daniel is given the choice of helping the police catch a bunch of German bank robbers dubbed " The Mercedes Gang " or lose his driving license Did I say this was entertaining ? It's also very likable and much of that's down to Besson's screenplay which is devoid of the sometimes sickening violence which did spoil for me NIKITA and LEON and they only hint that it was written by Besson being the fact that policemen are stupid . You do get the impression from all of his movies that Besson has a pathological dislike of cops but thankfully he doesn't get too polemical this time . Director Gerard Pires complements the screenplay by casting two young and likable actors in the lead roles There are a couple of flaws to TAXI . While being the chase and crash sequences are well directed it's unlikely cars flip up into the air as seen here . There's also a plot hole in that if the cops know where the raids are going to take place they don't bring in helicopter surveillence , but again being a Besson script the police are portrayed as being terminally stupid so I don't know if it's a plot hole as such . One thing that did annoy me is Daniel and Emilien sharing a joint which is a scene that certainly wasn't needed in the filmBut I saw several films the day I saw this and TAXI was undoubtedly the best movie I saw that day . It's not too difficult to see why the French film industry has been so successful over the years
Dynamic Piece Of Speculative Fantasy	Seen the cast list for JFK ? Tommy Lee Jones , Gary Oldman , Sissy Spacek , Kevin Bacon , Jack Lemmon , Walter Matthau , Donald Sutherland and John Candy in one movie . Even if you're not keen on some of the aforementioned actors you'll be impressed by all of their performances and for this reason alone JFK is essential viewing . The only actor I wasn't impressed with was Kevin Costner but I don't recall ever being impressed by him in anything he's ever done . But don't let that put you off because the rest of the cast are superb If that's not a strong enough recommendation let me point out the technical endeavor this movie required of mixing stock film footage and reconstructions which could have ended up making this movie a jarring unwatchable mess . Joe Hutshing and Pietro Scalia's editing is flawless while Robert Richardson's cinematography is outstanding and Oliver Stone maybe accused of over directing his later movies ( Notably NATURAL BORN KILLERS ) but here everything works perfectly from the directorUnfortunately Stone's script has to come in for the movie's most serious criticism - It's paranoid speculation , so much so that there's a danger JFK goes beyond fiction and becomes fantasy . First off it insinuates Kennedy was killed because he wanted to pull out of Vietnam . Considering there's little evidence of this where does this source information come from ? It's a well known fact that Kennedy was a fan of special forces and increased the budget and manpower for the green berets . Does this strike you as a man who'd totally pull out of South East Asia ? Secondly Vietnam would have meant very little from a pentagon chief to the American on the street in so we're to take it a country hardly anyone had heard of led to the murder of the President because he was going to pull US advisors out of Vietnam ? In that case I wonder why no one murdered Reagen because of he didn't send advisors to aid Christian phalangists in The Lebanon or why no one murdered Clinton because he didn't send advisors to aid the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan ? Thirdly , there seems to be an agenda in the screenplay that Kennedy was murdered so that the Vietnam war would generate money for American companies . I can't disprove this conspiracy theory of course , but think about this - Why would America sacrifice 58 , 000 war dead , have another 250 , 000 Americans maimed for life and lose all moral prestige in order to build a few thousand helicopters ? They could have easily supplied billions of dollars worth of military equipment to South Vietnam ( America did do this under the Vietnamization program in the early 70s ) without getting caught up in the quagmire themselves Oh and there's several other points the script kicks up that can't be proved or disproved like Lee Harvey Oswald being a double agent working for the CIA against world communism , a mysterious character only known as X who sees senior military chiefs planning to do away with Kennedy etc , things that only probably only exist in the imagination of Jim Garrison and Oliver Stone . Stone also wrote the Oscar winning screenplay of MIDNIGHT EXPRESS , read the source book by Billy Hayes and you'll realize that the screenplay to the book is a series of mass exaggerations and inventions on the part of Stone . He's done the same with JFK I don't want to give the impression that I disliked the movie because I didn't . However much of the movie makes claims and insinuation that can't be backed up by facts and if you think there's nothing wrong making a conspiracy theory blockbuster involving human tragedy think about this : Someone makes a movie called where Mossad agents are seen covertly entering the United States , everyone in the WTC calling Rubinstien and Goldberg phone up sick on the day of the attacks and a fictional character in the film states that he's seen documents in the White House proving that the war on terrorism is a big conspiracy involving Israel's government and American oil companies who were both behind the attacks carried out on the 9th September 2001 . Does anyone else feel disgusted we might be seeing this production in the future ?
One Of The Better Films From The Sub-Genre	It's interesting to note how forgotten the sub-genre of " People from hell " films are today . In the early 1990s every major studio would bring out a nanny from hell , a lodger from hell , a fan from hell , a client from hell etc etc . Perhaps the reason they're forgotten is down to the fact that the movies weren't very good and suffered from being formulaic ? Certainly UNLAWFUL ENTRY is one of the more entertaining movies in its field and it's probably down to the cast . Kurt Russell who unfortunately seems to have disappeared from successful films over the last few years was always good at playing good guy everyman and here plays architect Michael Carr . Madeleine Stowe is someone else who seems to have disappeared from the radar recently plays his wife Karen and they both make a likable and believable on screen couple with Karen being the object of lust of sociopathic cop Pete Davis played by Ray Liotta . Okay I doubt if any of the cast were expecting Oscar nominations but the on screen chemistry makes UNLAWFUL ENTRY a very watchable film There are some problems . Liotta is good enough when Davis is just an ordinary cop but when he acts all mean , nasty and obsessive he does tend to go over the top and unlike his two co-stars you can't really scratch your head wondering why Liotta now appears in obscure straight to video / DVD movies . Likewise the screenplay does became more and more unbelievable in the second half but that's always the problem with these type of movies . Not to be too negative it's still a watchable piece of entertainment
If Only All Bond Films Were This Good	Watching DR NO after all these years the first thing to strike me is how gritty it all is . The villains are cruel and not below shooting unarmed women in the back so who better to take them on than an equally cold hearted killer namely James Bond 007 . Bond must have shocked cinema audiences in the 1960s , no one described as a good guy in pre Bond cinema ever shot one of the bad guys in the back no matter what the provocation . John Wayne didn't do it and neither did Errol Flynn but here we see Sean Connery doing it even though he didn't have to . And I'm making no distinction between Sean Connery and the character he plays , James Bond is Sean Connery . Try saying " James Bond " out loud . Done it ? Notice the slightly slurred Scottish brogue . Try it again . See it's impossible not to say " Bond . Jamesh Bond " Let's not forget Connery made Bond a cultural icon and Connery was at one point the world's most famous and highest paid movie star . Not bad for a man who started off life in an Edinburgh tenement and whose first paid job was as a milk boyOne final thing I noticed about DR N0 is how tightly written and paced it is . Plot point is followed by murder attempt followed by plot point followed by murder attempt followed by plot point . At no time does any of this seem forced and at no time do we see 15-20 minutes padded out with a ridculous stunt sequence . If only all Bond films were as good as this or GOLDFINGER
Effective Chiller But Drags At Points	I remember seeing THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN as a child and being terrified by it mainly down to the opening scenes of a USAF unit going into a deserted village to retrieve a crashed satellite and finding . . . . You'll have to watch the movie to find out what . But after re-seeing the movie again as an adult I can still say the opening sequence is heart stopping in its tension simply down to the fact that the audience is allowed to use its imagination as to what has happened to the villagers and the recovery team . This is one of the most effective openings I have ever seen in a science fiction movieUnfortunately it's impossible for the production to keep up the tension though I will give credit for everyone involved in trying . It's just that for reasons of plot the story then revolves around a small team of uber scientists sitting in an underground lab researching something they've found from outer space and finding a way of making sure it doesn't wipe out life on Earth . The main problem is that the story then starts getting bogged down in scientific fact which makes it very difficult for the audience , then to appease the audience the last ten minutes involve a literal race against time which wouldn't look out of place in a James Bond movie . I guess a mainstream audience member who disliked the massive amount of techno-babble on display perked up at the exciting countdown at the end while a microbiologist student who understood the technical dialogue wished the movie had ended on a more intelligent note There are one or two other slight problems . I did find Dr Ruth Leavitt , written and played as some beatnik intellectual very irritating . But I guess if THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was remade today we'd see Hilary Duff or Lindsay Lohan as a nobel prize winning scientist so let's not complain about Kate Reid's performance too much . Unless I missed something isn't there a plot hole involving a crashed Phantom jet ? What caused it to crash ? Surely it couldn't have been exposed to the alien visitor unlike say the helicopter that brought back the satellite But I shouldn't nit pick too much since THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is a very effective sci-fi chiller though a more modern audience might be put off by a large amount of talky scenes and an absence of special effects
Greatest Cliffhanger Ever In A Very Variable Self Indulgent Episode	Just to remind you how popular Nu-Who is I overheard a conversation between a couple of schoolgirls at a bus stop the week before this episode was broadcast " Dae ya ken what's happening on Saturday ? " " What ? " " Sarah Jane's coming back and Mickey and Rose's mum " Hey I thought to myself . Teenage girls think DOCTOR WHO is the most important and coolest show in the universe . Who says the youth of today have little hope ? It's astounding how much of a success the show has become . The only worry is would RTD throw a spanner in the works ? The answer is sometimes yes and sometimes no . Unfortunately the answer yes isn't a clear cut winner with The Stolen Earth Certainly RTD has pandered to the hardcore viewer weather they be middle aged men or teenage girls . The whole story revolves around continuity and nostalgia so much so that the narrative collapse beneath the weight of it . We see characters like Harriet Jones and the rhino monsters from Smith And Jones brought in to the fray only for them to disappear so abruptly you find yourself wondering was it really necessary to include them in the first place . Davros makes a welcome return and is shown to have embryo Daleks growing within himself but this is skated over so quickly you realise it's only been included because it seemed like a good idea at the time . Being an end of season story we have the obligatory cameos in the shape of Prof Richard Dawkins and Paul O'Grady and a plot line featuring the planet Earth on the brink of inevitable defeat . I for one would have been happier to have substituted nostalgia and spectacle and running around for a bit more drama as wehad in Bad Wolf / Parting Of The Ways The Stolen Earth does have some very good elements . Piper and Tate are both excellent in their roles so much so that it works against the rest of the female cast . Cribbens is also excellent whilst Julian Bleach as Davros is second only to the late Michael Wisher as the best Davros though his part remained underwritten . Undoubtedly though the best part of the story is the ending which contains the greatest cliffhanger the show has ever seen and I'm including the classic series in that equation . When a not so young man who has seen every episode that remains in the BBC archive says that his jaw hit the ground as the end credits came up you know you've been watching event television This is an episode that is wildly variable . The writing is patchy but that's only to be expected in 50 minutes of television that brings in continuity from the first four series of Nu-Who not to mention the two spin off series TORCHWOOD and THE SARAH JANE ADVENTURES and whilst not as talented as Joe Ahearne director Graeme Harper does the best with the material . If here's a fundamental problem it's mainly down to RTD as a producer who commissions his own writing . One hopes we shall see his autocratic type of producing end when he leaves the show
The Best Environmental Film Of Its Era	As with all environmentally aware films from the 1970s SOYLENT GREEN has a rather cheesy view of what ecological meltdown is . Overpopulation means there's too many people to feed ? I was under the impression that famines were caused by either war or failed economic policies . Stalin's policy in the Soviet Union in the 1930s left millions dead because of famine and to this day the greatest man made tragedy was Mao's rural policy in China which led over 30 million starvation deaths in the 1950s . And let's not forget the great famines in the horn of Africa in the 1980s and 90s which were to do with conflicts not overpopulation . You might like to also consider that two of the most heavily populated areas on Earth , Hong Kong and Macau , have never suffered a famine in modern times . Likewise the expansion of shanty towns around cities as seen here isn't strictly down to overpopulation - it's down to economic factors where people flock to cities to find better paid work than in the countryside ( It's a symptom of industrial progress - not of too many births ) so the image of the streets of New York city being too congested to walk through and of having people sleep in stairwells is somewhat laughableBut don't be fooled into thinking SOYLENT GREEN is a pile of corny tree hugging crap because I consider this to be the best ecological film of the70s . It plays on the contempary audience's knowledge of the world where Sol and Thorn are beside themselves with joy at finding fruit , brandy and fresh meat . Thorn gasps in amazement at having ice in his whisky , puffs on a cigarette and delivers the classic line " If I could afford it I'd smoke two , maybe three of these a day " . But it's the visage of the euthanasia chamber that's memorable as Thorn gazes at the images of wild animals , flowers , running water and snow covered mountains , a world Thorn's generation has never known . This is a very haunting scene which makes SOYLENT GREEN a very memorable film , combined with the fact it features the final screen appearance of Edward G Robinson as the wise old Jew Sol Roth
Good For The Most Part	This has got to be one the most funny and entertaining films ever to have been set in Scotland . My only gripes are the accents are obviously West of Scotland when it's set in Edinburgh , a pedantic point but I come from Edinburgh originally but have spent most of my life in the West of Scotland so the erroneous accents stick out a mile to the trained ear , and the fact RESTLESS NATIVES suffers very badly from a weak ending . But this film is still a lot of fun
Works Better As A history Lesson Than A Film	ZULU DAWN lives in the shadow of ZULU . That's hardly surprising because ZULU is the much better film , however unlike the 1964 film DAWN does stick to historical accuracy . The British are portrayed rightly as being overconfident , arrogant and foppish and it's this hubristic attitude that has lost wars when a superpower looks down its nose at the fighting capabilities of a backward third world nation . The British almost repeated the same mistakes during the Boar war , and the French and Americans done it in south east Asia , and the red army did it in Afghanistan . DAWN does chronicle in great depth the mistakes made at the battle of Isandlwana : Chelmsford split his forces , the army didn't reinforce the perimeter , they were spread too thinly , and the method of supplying ammo was totally flawed , but it's this that spoils the film , there is too much emphasis of what happened to cause this defeat . Despite having an all star cast ( Two of which won Oscars and a couple more who have been nominated ) there's little character focus and you care little for the people involved . The film would have worked much better if it concentrated on just Chelmsford and Bob Hoskins gruff Sgt Major instead of the many characters who drift in and out of the picture ZULU DAWN isn't a complete waste of time though , despite the long wait the battle scenes are handled well ( But not as good as ZULU ) and like ZULU it shows that a lot of brave men died on both sidesUpdate March 2008 . Recent historical evidence suggests that ZULU DAWN is fairly inaccurate especially where mass ranks , or the lack of them are concerned . But still knowing what historians knew in 1979 it's still a serious attempt to portray the battle accurately at the time
Very Amusing	The premise of this short film is very simple : Arthur works in an office and fancies one of his colleagues called Beryl but she's not interested in him because Arthur is " aesthetically challenged " When I say the premise is simple that should be intended as a compliment and nothing less . Likewise it's also a premise that a great number of men will identify with . Okay the attempts of Arthur to woo Beryl may not be entirely realistic but that's not really the point of ARTHUR'S AMAZING THINGS , its function is merely to entertain and amuse the audience and as someone who's not really a fan of short films I was genuinely entertained and amused and I even laughed out loud a couple of times . I think Martin Gooch is a film maker who has a bright future in front of him and I'd like to see this guy get a few breaks
I Laughed Out Loud	FAMILY MISFORTUNES shows the dangers humanity faces due to a shrinking gene pool . You often wonder why people go onto game shows considering they're so retarded well in this one off edition of FAMILY FORTUNES we're left wondering why some people should be allowed to reproduce . Take this exampleQ : Name something you open ? A : Your legs Talk about a one track mind . There was one contestant who was so stupid that he features several times Q : Name a famous Arthur ? A : ShakespeareHe might misheard the question as " Name a famous author ? " but this guy is a right dummy because the idiocy continues Q : Name a famous Irishman ? A : Disraeli And then in a classic TV moment we see him going for the big money bit at the end of the show with Max Bygraves asking the questionsQ : Name something you take to the beach ? A : Turkey Q : Something you buy in a supermarket ? A : Turkey Q : Something that gets stuffed ? A : Oh , turkey The noise sounds for time up and the camera cuts to the contestants family one of whom can be clearly seen to mutter the " F " and " C " words . Looks like the turkey wasn't the only thing to get stuffed when everyone got home . Bygraves retorts " You've just won two weeks in Turkey , and you've won some money so you can take that back to the lunatic asylum " Mr Dummy gives a good natured laugh and the camera cuts back to his family who are giving him hate filled looks and who at any moment may just do something that you'd expect to see on THE JERRY SPRINGER SHOW A very funny one off show , but if I remember correctly there were a couple of other editions that followed that weren't half as good
Short On Thought . Long On Thrills	RONIN is to all intents and purposes a highly intelligent thriller , or so it would seem on the surface . Unfortunately when you start to examine the plot and structure of the movie it starts to fall apart . These " Ronin " characters - Who are they ? Who employed them ? Where was the job advertised ? It's never really revealed , perhaps just as well since it'd be impossible to explain how such a motley bunch can be taken seriously . Notice one of the characters is a Walter Mitty type but can get the group any type of gun they want , and is this Walter Mitty guy really necessary to the plot ? , he's written out after 20 minutes and it's difficult to understand why he was included by the final draft . Let's look at the plot . In his book STORY : THE PRINCIPLES OF SCREENWRITING Robert Mckee explained that when he was a script reader for Hollywood studios he'd only be sent two types of script neither of which really worked , one being an understructured real life type drama and an overstructured action thriller involving an object all the great powers want to get their hands on . RONIN certainly sums up the second type of script , the CIA , the Russians , the IRA and quite possibly the winter olympics commitee are after something that will change the world as we know it and it's up to this group of hired guns to cross , double cross and triple cross one another to get their hands on it RONIN could have turned out a complete mess and despite the movie never being as clever as it thinks it is neither does it become the complete debacle it could have become . My exceedingly high entertainment thresholds were met and then some more and much of it had to do with the cast . This movie hardly features DeNiro's greatest performance but considering the complete rubbish he's appeared in since the early 1990s he's by no means bad and does manage to bring some moral charm to his character . Jean Reno and Stellan Skarsgard are two of the greatest actors Europe has produced in the last twenty years and it's very interesting to see these fine actors in a high octane Hollywood thriller and British Equity is very well represented with Sean Bean and Jonathan Pryce A highly effective and entertaining thriller which at times is over complicated and plot bare at the same time . Can you imagine the mess Jerry Brukheimer and Michael Bay would have made of this ?
I Was Caught Out	I watched this aged ten and was compelled by the subject matter , scientists disappearing across the world , an apollo mission astronaut loosing his temper while being asked questions as to what he saw on a moon mission , and most disturbing of all secret NASA footage from Mars showing something alive burrowing just under the surface of the red planet . An absolutely shocking investigation . It wasn't untill a few days later that I found out it was an April fool . I didn't feel stupid about getting fooled , after all I was only a child , but I did feel very angry that there was no proof of life on Mars . Just think though , there must still be literally thousands of people walking around today who still believe this was a real investigative report
A Great Movie Due To Its Romantic Ideals	Did you know that Karl Marx hero was Spartacus ? There's something deeply ironic about this because the film version of SPARTACUS has so many Marxist ideals it could have been subtitled " THE STORY OF AN ENLIGHTENED PROLETERIAN HERO " As film buffs may know the screenwriter of SPARTACUS Dalton Trumbo was blacklisted by the Hollywood studio system because of alleged communist sympathies and it's impossible not to notice that Trumbo has done a sort of leftist inversion of John Ford's " Always make the legend " mantra . As a history lesson SPARTACUS is rather poor , if you look up the goofs on this page you'll notice that no one has really bothered to their home work as to the history , politics and machinations of ancient Rome with perhaps the most striking piece of speculation is the myth that Spartacus was from a Greek province sold into slavery when it's far more likely he was a Roman legionnaire who was sent to gladiator school but I guess the being sold into slavery makes for a better story But this very simplistic black and white view of history can be forgiven because it's what makes SPARTACUS a great movie , we know who the bad guys are and why they're bad guys ( They're rich and cruel ) and we know who the good guys are and why they're good guys ( They're poor but noble ) and therefore the audience know instantly whose side they're on SPARTACUS is also a film famous because its director Stanley Kubrick supposedly hated it mainly down to the fact that he didn't have any involvement in the screenplay . What ? A director dislikes a movie of this standard ? I'm certain Spielberg or Scorsese would have killed to make a movie this good . It contains fine performances from all the cast but the stand outs are Douglas , Simmons , Laughton ( Someone else alleged to have had leftist sympathies ) Olivier and Ustinov , so many fine actors in one movie and you don't notice how many different accents used until it's pointed out to you . Check out those battle scenes at the end and remember this was long before CGI so these were real people making up the slave and Roman armies but for me the greatest scene of the film and one of the most haunting scenes I have ever seen is where Woody Strode and Kirk Douglas sit facing each other waiting to go into the arena . What makes it even more spellbinding is that there's no dialogue at all , we only hear the sounds of the previous contestants fighting to the death Without doubt a movie that deserves to be in the IMDb Top 250 Movies list and possibly Kubrick's best film , he certainly didn't make anything as good as this ever again . But it's a movie that was ignored for most of the major awards at that years Oscar nominations . I guess that because the Oscars are a celebration of American film making talent they didn't want to give awards to movies celebrating communist heroes
A Breathtaking Conclusion To Cinema's Greatest Fantasy Epic	It takes a miracle for me to go the cinema since smoking is banned in cinema chains but Peter Jackson is a miracle worker . How else would he be able to make me forget my filthy and disgusting nicotine addiction ? He made me forget all about cigarettes for three hours with THE TWO TOWERS and I knew that with RETURN OF THE KING he could make me forget all about ciggies for a record breaking three and a half hours . I booked my ticket for Rothesay winter gardens cinema and sat down to be enthralled ! ! ! ! ! SPOILERS ! ! ! ! ! I do conclude there are some people in the world who can't see what the fuss is about with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy . My parents seem slightly puzzled that their cynical critical son loves LOTR . It's simply explained , these epic movies aren't a childish fantasy , they're like David Lean filming a Shakespeare play , but I do take onboard the criticism that the story structure of the movies can be irritating . FELLOWSHIP is very stop-start while the action intercutting in TTT can be annoying but ROTK has probably the best pace and structure of the three . ROTK starts with a sequence showing Smeagol murdering his friend in order to get the ring . This gives some needed backstory to Gollum . It also sets up its stall that it's not a family film never mind a " childish fantasy " . In fact I predict that many of the children in Rothesay cinema will be having nightmares tonight due to the scenes with that horrible big spider , it made my skin crawl and the woman sitting next to me was gasping out loud as it prepared to cocoon poor Frodo , you should have seen the Q for the toilet after that scene which tells you how convincing the FX are in this movie , nothing appears CGI : Gollum isn't computer generated he's a living being and Peter Jackson doesn't use camera trickery for fight scenes he uses million upon millions of extras . He is David Lean reincarnated . No he is David Lean AND Will Shakespeare reincarnated , look at the way the cast act their parts , it's like they're appearing in the greatest play of the bard . Their performances are superlativeThere are some flaws . I did mention the script gives background to Smeagol but the script - Like the other films in the trilogy - is somewhat uneven . John Noble's character Denethor seems somewhat underwritten and I wasn't sure what his motivation was . Also as everyone else has mentioned the false endings are very irritating . When Aragorn is crowned king and the screen faded to black the audience reached for their Jackets and bags then we're shown another scene lasting several minutes which faded to a blaze of music . Everyone reached for their bags and jackets , then another scene which . . . It would have been better to have seen Aragorn crowned King and then seen Frodo sailing into the distance but I guess after the screenwriters have irritated us with the abrupt endings of the first two movies it's somewhat traditional to irritate with the end of the trilogy . These faults I can forgive but there is an unforgivable cop out of having an army of the undead charging to save the race of men from the Orc army at the end . It didn't ruin the movie for me but it just seems so lazy and contrived which stopped me from thinking it was the best movie in the trilogy , it's not , FELLOWSHIP is . But still this is a masterpiece of cinema which like cigarettes left me breathless and satisfied and hopefully we'll see it sweep the Oscar ceremony at lastAs for the Oscars themselves I'm puzzled about a couple of things . Howard Shore's score is beautiful and haunting but it's far from original with much of the music in ROTK re-used from FELLOWSHIP ( The Gondor theme ) and TTT ( The Celtic music ) while the omissions are even more surprising . No nominations for any of the actors ! I know that all the great performances would cancel each other out but it's shameful Andy Serkis wasn't nominated as best supporting actor . Can anyone name a more unlikable baddie than Gollum in recent cinema ? Me neither and no nomination for cinematography ! I've no idea how John Lesnie's camera was able to keep up with the action and he deserved at least a nomination so maybe we'll see the third instalment robbed on Oscar night like FELLOWSHIP was . Even if it is that doesn't stop me and millions of other film fans from recognising the genuis of Peter Jackson . I bow to you Sir
