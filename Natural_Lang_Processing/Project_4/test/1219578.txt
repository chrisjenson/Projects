the death of a film	Michel ( José Garcia ) is a writer who pens books for children . Everything is fine in his well-regulated life until one day , his wife Hélène leaves for a Chinese lover . From then onwards , everything goes askew for Michel . He has to come to terms with a serious block and he's especially despondent by his wife's departure . One sole idea remains stuck on his mind : to find again this Chinese lover named Tong and kill him ( hence the title of the film ) . Alas ! Manipulated by some of his peers and abusing alcohol and drugs , the frontier between reality and imagination becomes increasingly thin and madness is around the corner . . . It's really a shame when a film has a true potential or tries to renew a corny situation ( here , the eternal love triangle with a man whom wife deceives him with her lover and he wants to slay him ) and totally misses the point . When one watches this hare-brained film , one can guess Jean-Louis Benoît's intentions : to underline Michel's absurd actions and the ways tapped for this to find Hélène and Tong again , to depersonalize Michel and put him in the throes of madness . But it's well known : the best intentions in the world will never supersede a good film . When one deciphers the story which would seem basically oddball , one notices that Benoît's film is an ill-conceived plan on several aspects . The absence of clarity and dramatic progression are blatant and the scenario is given a desultory treatment with some plot holes . For instance , Michel's editor is incensed by the ramblings stories his writer produces . The problem lies in the fact that we don't always see Michel writing the stories his editor talks about . Then , after Hélène left him with Tong , some Chinese removal men who often come out of the blue move Hélène's furniture and stuff . Why Michel doesn't ask them where Hélène is gone with Tong ? Another negative point are the sequences with the policeman acted by François Berléand . Were they necessary for the plot ? It's tempting to deem them as filler . And the absurd humor with which Benoît tries to shroud some parts of his movie ( the moments when Michel searches his fiancée in unlikely places or with outlandish tricks ) generally make these moments fall flat . Another mistake involves the cast . There is a bevy of true actors here ( Garcia , Denis Podalydès , Isabelle Carré ) who can shine when they are perfectly guided . But here , it's glaring that the directing of actors isn't the director's forte . They overplay and mix up third-rate acting with humor . I strongly advise you to watch them elsewhere . For example , Denis Podalydès in his brother Bruno's films and if you think that José Garcia is bound to be exclusively typecast in comical roles , well you should have a look at " Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte " ( 1999 ) , a deeply pessimistic work by Philippe Harel . So , in the end , what's left in store : a wholly film which speaks volume about the level of input of its creator in his venture . Once again , an unfunny , shoddy film which doesn't make the viewer laugh constitutes a feat from its author .
A big bore .	This is one of those road movies that would like to tell you a lotta things about women , the universe , the better life , the terrible solitude of the brilliant architect from Manhattan who severs all links with everyone , including his three years old child - which may seem irresponsible to some-Actually the hero wins hands down when it comes to selfishness and the scene with his old school pal , which begins as some kind of good old days conversation and ends on a threatening note is the oasis in a desert movie . The scene with - the - father - who - left - home - when - I-was-a child has been told and told and TOLD . Of course it did not prevent the offspring from making his way of life . And when you see the hero's wife's attitude , you may think she must never have heard about woman's lib . The best is the soundtrack which includes superb songs by Willie Nelson , Tom Waits or Bonnie Raitt . . . But you can enjoy them without this tedious pretentious work .
" Les yeux sans visage " remake .	Georges Franju's remarkable horror film had a deep influence on that kind of cinema : even Amenabar's " abre los ojos " is a good example of what Franju brought to the fantasy and horror movies . The first sex-horror film ! claimed the tagline . Well for that matter , Murnau's " Nosferatu " came first . Claude Mulot's script is thin , mean and lacks humor and substance . A poor man's " les yeux sans visage " indeed . But it manages to retain some - minor - interest . The castle where a lady who was disfigured in a fire ( Duperrey ) is waiting for a doctor who will give her back her beauty ; but this man's methods - blackmailed by the lady's husband - are illegal to say the least for he needs warm young flesh , well you know the score . We never see the lady's horrible face , only her eyes - like Rosemary's baby - , and there's a lot of camera taking first-person point of view . Two sinisters dwarfs appear now and then . Claude Mulot sometimes manages to create a dreamlike atmosphere , but once again , his script is really half-backed .
Oh my God ! They ( John Travolta and Roger Christian ) killed science-fiction !	In the world of the cinema , there's one thing I don't understand and that I find mysterious : how with a pharaonic budget can we produce such appalling movies ? Roger Christian should have thought about it before he began shooting his film . He even should have given up his project . An important amount of money would have been saved . The place of " Battlefield Earth " in the top of the worst movies in IMDB is absolutely justified . This film's got every conceivable fault , every imaginable fault so that you can name it : the perfect load of rubbish : a stupid script full of flaws , rotten special effects , ludicrous actors , beginning with John Travolta . It's so overwhelmed with mediocrity that you quickly get tired of an extremely manichean plot . Nothing can be saved from a movie which is quite similar to " Planet of the apes " ( 1968 ) by Franklin Schaffner . The worst movie made in 2000 . TO AVOID !
Pretentious . .	Sautet had jettisoned his films noirs influences which gave the great " Classes tous Risques " and the good " L'Arme à Gauche " . One could have thought that " Max et les Ferrailleurs " his best film in the seventies would herald a return to form as well as a return to what he did best . But " Vincent François , Paul et les Autres " had continued his chronicles of bourgeois-with-a-tender-heart which " Cesar et Rosalie " had begun ( " les Choses de la Vie " is a different matter since it has an emotional power the subsequent works have not ) " Mado " is more of the same . Bourgeois " in danger of despair " to quote Sautet himself . And zombie Dutronc on top of that . The scene when the cars get bogged down in the mud is the most grotesque metaphor I ' ve ever seen in a movie . " It's the movie itself which gets bogged down " sneered the critics at the time . Romy Schneider's fans , beware ! Her appearance does not exceed five minutes ( in a 2hours + movie ) !
Yellow revolver .	Yes there IS a yellow revolver in this movie . What else ? Well not much . A girl who was a gangster's hostage tries to latch on to lots of dough . But alas there's a private eye of an insurance company and a female cop who know more than they should . The heroine lies through her teeth ( and she kills every time she needs it with remarkable ease ) hence the necessity to provide the audience with numerous flashbacks which confuse more than they explain . Obviously influenced by Claude Chabrol , a commendable director , and Jean-Pierre Mocky , who's always shooting us a line , " Yellow revolver " , like " tir à vue " is a poor work in Sandrine Bonnaire's filmography .
After an intriguing start , it amounts to ( almost ) nothing	Do not let the Gospel reference fool you : it is not the return of Pasolini ! It has nothing to do with the Holy Writ ! Actually , this Beauvois work begins quite well , with a hunting scene , followed by a meal where the conversation is probably improvised , à la Cassavetes . Then a wedding scene which is not unlike that in Chabrol's " le boucher " . So it takes at least twenty minutes before the story really begins . Then it's downhill . As soon Baye's character is on the screen , the movie has nothing in store for the audience . The movie begins and ends with very pretentious music , that shows a tendency to make the viewer feel he's going to watch ( or has been watching ) an " important " " meaningful " " deep " work . The worst of it is , one suspects that Beauvois actually believes he's made a genuine sleeper , and does not know , has no idea at all that it's the bland and hackneyed bourgeois / blue collar love affair it actually seems to me . Mind you , Xavier , Luke , John , and Mark are up for grabs .
North by southeast	I will not tell in detail the summary of this film . It's the umpteenth version of two cops who love the same woman and have no other choice than to collaborate together to arrest a dangerous gangster ( François Levantal ) on the French Riviera . But as one of them ( Pascal Elbé ) discovered that his team mate ( Jean Dujardin ) slept with his wife , it makes him uptight and makes their mission harder to fulfill . And things get more difficult when Elbé's wife rejoins them and has an important piece of news to tell them . Philippe De Chauveron is the responsible man for the mediocre and somewhat desultory " les Parasites " ( 1999 ) . Here , he proves once again that he is a third-rate director with unambitious , cinematographic choices . How can you renew the well-worn genre of the buddy movie , especially with a dash of sentimental genre in it ? In spite of efforts not to make the main female part decorative and Dujardin's and Elbé's honest performances , the rest doesn't take off . The film oscillates between several types of humor without managing to find its direction and it sometimes falls flat because it's too convenient . See the scene when Dujardin and Elbé are about to nab their quarry . Elbé can see a couple tenderly kissing and of course can't help but asking questions to Dujardin about his affair with his wife . Another irritating point is when Dujardin and Elbé's wife constantly plan to tell him the truth about the important piece of news mentioned in the first paragraph but can't managed to do so and have to delay it . Philippe De Chauveron doesn't manage to find a correct proportioning between the detective investigation and what deals with the two cops ' sentimental problems . And what doesn't help matters is that they're of a thin interest . And so , so is the viewer's who slowly but surely wanes . I won't also forget Levantal's mediocre performance as a hateful gangster with ponderous features . It's not worth a watch .
An overrated work .	Like most of the nouvelle vague works , " Adieu Philippine " seems dated now . Some people will praise it to the skies , other will find it a bit boring and tedious . The first part is the best : the depiction in a quasi documentary way of the TV studios , the meal at the hero's home where his parents and grand-parents are discussing barroom politics , the stupid commercials - the movie was prophetic for that matter - . The spontaneity of the actors is convincing . There's a sword of Damocles hanging over the hero's head : in two months , he will be drafted and will have to fight in Algeria , French dirty war . That's perhaps the most amazing thing : nobody , neither the future soldier nor his girlfriends or relatives seem to take it seriously . He will go , period . That makes the movie unintentionally a bit reactionary , particularly if we compare it to old wave Autant-Lara's contemporary " tu ne tueras point " . The second part is nouvelle vague flesh on the bone : a very loose plot , and a very loooong ending . Sincerely , I doubt the 2002 audience can relate to such amateurish directing . Some will say the hero wants to make the best of what is left to him : but nothing vibrates and everything seems hollow . The movie was a flop and did get critical acclaim afterwards . So , my opinion is probably not very orthodox .
The grim reaper	When you reach a peak such as Swank's part in " Million dollar baby " , the only way is down . And " the reaping " is a very poor fantasy and horror movie ; the screenplay seems to have been made by a computer . The ingredients are taken from other movies : 1 . The scene where the heroine takes refuge in a hut was stolen from Hitchcock's " the birds " 2 . The nightmare - which provides the obligatory final unexpected twist - was borrowed , one more time , from Polanski's " Rosemary ' baby " . 3 . When Swank wants to kill the young girl , how couldn't you think of Gregory Peck trying to get rid of Damien in " the omen " ? And the part of the priest ( Stephen Rea ) directly comes from " the omen " too . 4 . The insects were already in Boorman's " The heretic " , the sequel to " the exorcist " . The only interesting moment happens when professor Swank explains the plagues of Egypt , in a scientific way .
There's nothing at the end of the rainbow .	The movie begins as a rip-off of Richard Brooks ' " Elmer Gantry " ( 1961 ) ( R . Arquette recalling Jean Simmons ) , then continues as a " the eyes of Laura Mars " ( 1978 ) imitation . Then finally David Cronenberg's " dead zone " serves as an inspiration to the director for the finale . The epilogue , whIch tries to " surprise " the audience has already been used one hundred times or more . Arquette's character's behavior does not make much sense : now a chaste and sweet saint , now a formidable nymphomaniac who rapes poor Tom Hulce . It's a cock and bull story , and as I've already said , the magpie syndrome is rampant . Best avoid .
A waste of money	French producers must have lots and lots of dough to throw down the drain ! Why produce such a thing ? About 10 % of the movie is , at a pinch , funny , 40 % is filler - a nice way to have a good time in New-York , London and Hollywood - and 40 % is the success story all over again . To be successful , such a story should have been mad , a la Billy Wilder . Here it's more a glorification of a system based on cash than a spoof on the pictures business . To give you an idea of the level of humor , the new boss congratulates Leonardo Di Caprio ( we only see the " actor " ' s back ) for " Titanic " , " The iron Mask " and . . . " Star Wars " .
mafia blues 2 : the relapse	Harold Ramis seems to have found his bearings in American comedy through the repetition . In Groundhog Day ( 1993 ) , he condemned Bill Murray to live the same day over and over again . In " Multiplicity " ( 1996 ) , he gave Michael Keaton the opportunity to clone himself in four different characters . Here , for the third time in his career , the repetition strikes again . " Analyze This " was a big success in 1999 and a sequel was likely to be awaited . But this follow-up mainly obeys to a commercial logic . Quite obviously , Ramis wanted to use the recipes again that made the success of the first movie . As we say : it's always the same old people . . . for a rather unexciting film ! I watched " Analyze This " during a flight for Canada in 1999 and I thought it wasn't too bad but not memorable . What did I think of " Analyze That " ? I quite hated it . The duo Robert De Niro / Billy Crystal is rather exhilarating and their scathing confrontations are running well . Besides , the director offers De Niro the opportunity to make fun of the type of character he acted in " The Godfather " ( 1972 ) or " Goodfellas " ( 1990 ) . On another hand , it is true that the movie takes off in the moments when the two protagonists are in identity crisis . For the rest , sorry Mr Ramis but I can't accept so much vulgarity in the dialogs , so much ponderousness in the style and so much inconsistence in the screenplay ( it is difficult to imagine De Niro looking for a job on Crystal's advice because he acts a character with a limited IQ ) . Moreover , the plot ( if there is one ! ) tends to fray and as soon as De Niro is hired as an adviser in dialogs for a television series , the rest of the film is just padding , notably when we arrive at the stickup sequence . Be that as it may , if you liked the first movie very much , " Analyze That " will please you . As for the others , to approach with caution .
An inexplicable success for this trite French love story .	" Marius and Jeannette " is a movie from Robert Guédiguian , a filmmaker who has almost always worked with the same actors . More important , this film that is supposed to be a tribute to the world of Marcel Pagnol was an unexpected success at the French box-office . I must admit that don't share this enthusiasm from the public at all . I would have liked not to have reserves about Guédiguian's work but it is impossible . I consider " Marius and Jeannette " as a really trite love story that takes in a popular district of Marseille ( it is useful to add that all Guédiguian's works take place in this big French city ) . Trite , because it follows a classical outline : meeting , love affair , misunderstanding , separation and reconciliation . Moreover , there's ponderousness in Guédiguian's style and it is particularly true when the film turns to comedy . Due to this characteristic , it is nearly impossible to laugh honestly in the moments supposed to be funny . In fact , the disappointment from " Marius and Jeannette " mostly lies in its screenplay . For example , it doesn't avoid vulgarity ( when Marius shows his bottom in the bar ) and doesn't exclude implausibilities either : Jeannette's daughter wants to go to Paris to study journalism . A good idea as long as you work hard enough to fulfill one's dream . But here , you don't see her opening a book or studying ! In another hand , the clichés linked to any love story haven't been forgotten : throughout the story , we learn that Marius ' former wife died in a car crash . An annoying point : the music . Too overwhelming and clumsily used in the way it badly suits to the atmosphere of certain scenes . All right , Robert Guédiguian introduces his characters with a lot of affection and tenderness ( particularly Marius ) but it is not sufficient enough to make this movie pleasant . Quite obviously , the director isn't gifted to shot a comedy based on a love story . He is more at ease and convincing when it comes to make a gritty and realistic representation of Marseille . Try " La Ville est Tranquille " ( 2000 ) for instead .
An improvement on " la cage aux rossignols " ?	" La cage aux rossignols " , released in 1945 , was one of the last movies of the occupation days . " Les choristes " , although they have transposed the action to the fifties , hints at it when a young brat breaks into " maréchal , nous voilà ! " , anthem of those dark years . The question is : was it necessary to redo ? Yes the songs are splendid and are likely to become part of the repertoire of all the French schools . Yes the boy who plays Morange mesmerizes the audience , and like Brigitte Fossey ( " jeux interdits " ) or Benoit Magimel ( " la vie est un long fleuve tranquille " ) he may become an actor when he grows up . The original screenplay has undergone some changes : it has become a long flashback , with an ending which focuses one more time on success and fame , borrowing more from " Professor Holland's opus " than to Dreville's old flick . The rebel pupil's sister has become an unmarried mother , which was unthinkable in the Petain years . Producer Jacques Perrin - who has seen better days , artistically speaking - appears as the umpteenth version of the ugly duckling turned into a swan . And finally the Jugnot vehicle has the same drawbacks as its model : the kids become quickly much too quickly a heavenly choir , andwe do know that , in both movies , the young actors are choristers in real life . The characters remain cardboard and Gérard Jugnot is neither better nor worse than Noël-Noël . What's amazing is that generally " la cage aux rossignols " is dismissed as cheesy and maudlin ( its rating is average ) while its remake is praised to the skies . It's the same old song though .
Another Mocky's botched job .	Jean - Pierre Mocky has made a lot of movies ; few gained critical acclaim and few ( if any ) were commercial successes . Although an adaptation of an American novel , the movie is Frenchie to the core . It has , mainly in its first part a crude dialog , using the word " baiser " ( = f . . . ) in almost every line . This film does nothing but state the obvious : a newspaper which wants to tell the truth all the truth and nothing but the truth is a hackneyed subject ; and Mocky treats his subject like a bull in a china shop . Besides , he cannot even enhance the all-star male cast ( Londsdale , Serrault , Constantin . . . ) the production generously bestowed on him ; one should add that the female cast is rather poor ( Sylvia " Emmanuelle " Krystel is very bad but one can see her swim in the nude in her pool ) . From time to time Mocky makes a good work ( " l'albatros " is probably the most interesting ) but they are oases in the desert of a burned out career .
Where have you been , Anastasia ?	Do not let the title fool you . Even if there're murders in this movie , it's not that bloody . Actually , the film reminds me of one of Lautner's best films " La Maison Assassinée " ( 1988 ) . Unfortunately , Nicolas Guillou's screenplay is rather weak and the lines particularly mediocre . " La Maison Assassinée " continued an old French tradition : the " rural " thriller , which included such memorable works as " L'Assassinat Du Père Noel " ( 1941 ) , " Goupi Mains Rouges " ( 1942 ) or " La Ferme des Sept Péchés " ( 1949 . There was a revival of the genre , in the early seventies , with a more " realistic " approach : " La Horse " " La Veuve Couderc " . . . . " Terre de Sang " would rather be part of the early forties works with its " mysterious " atmosphere and its gallery of weirdos ; " Maison Assassinée " brilliantly succeeded in this vein . " Terre de Sand " does not : it is a patchy inconsistent work , in spite of good actors we rarely see nowadays : Dominique Paturel was famous in the late sixties for playing D'Artagnan in the eponymous miniseries ; Ginette Garcin would have been ideally cast too , had she been given decent material . A woman and her daughter died in a fire . . . . Twenty years later , a young woman comes back to the village , pretending she is the late child . . . It was a good idea , but it does not work .
The multinationals work behind the scenes . . .	. . . and stay behind the scenes . A bizarre cast gathers French actors ( Chabrol's favorite , Michel Bouquet , Bruno Cremer , Pierre Santini , Henri Serre - remember Jim in " Jules et Jim " ? - ) , an actress who was also the script writer , under another name , and American stars such as Joseph Cotten and Dennis Hopper . Plus Donald Pleasance in a three-minute appearance . Because of a passport , a woman is involved in a story she does not understand at all ( the same goes for the viewer ) . The plot is too diffuse , the stakes too vague to successfully drag the audience . Hints at the third world , its cheap workforce and nukes are not convincing , even if the picture of the newspaper on the dead body is impressive enough . And the title is pretension itself .
Cold as a grave .	This movie enjoys a very good reputation in France . This is a bleak depressing dirge-like effort . A cop ( Marielle ) has lost his daughter ( killed by her mother , now in an insane asylum ) and he acts as if she's still alive , telling her about his investigation into a horrible murder . The last lines , when the detective visits the grave are almost unbearable . The two stories do not hang well together . And we cannot help but feel some homophobia and misogyny while we're watching Heynemann's flick . It's an earnest movie , but it's also a bit boring . The long conversations between the cop and his suspect become grating in the long run . The movie is dedicated to Edgar P . Jacobs . The connection between the creator of the adventures of Blake and Mortimer and the film escapes me , I fear . . . The hero's colleague is a true movie buff . And he mentions Frank Borzague's masterpieces such as " mortal storm " and " strange cargo " . Which is very dangerous . Because , personally , it makes me feel like ditching Heynemann and savoring Borzague . Heynemann's best film remains his first " la question " .
A blueprint for sequels - to-come .	The first " Friday ' retains a - relative - appeal ; it was filmed on location : the forest surrounding the fateful lake provides enough darkness and dangers to satisfy gore afficionados . There was a script , rudimentary admittedly , but a story anyway . The plot was inspired by Agatha Christie's " and then there were none " , omitting the whodunit side . There is at least two true actors , Kevin Bacon and Betsy Palmer . The suspense is relative too . Past the second third , every time a boy or a girl moves , you are sure that something horrible is going to happen to him / her . But , let's be honest : it's neither Hitchcock norClouzot . What's funny is that almost every sequel will follow exactly the same pattern : 1 . The adolescents arrive , exchange futile words , sometimes find love and make it . 2 . The killer goes into action , and , one by one , does away with all the fellas bar one . 3 . The survivor - always a girl ! ! - begins a desperate fight with the monster and wins . ( temporary , because you must secure the sequel ) . Thus , parts 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 are more of the same . Part 8 is a bit more original , moving to urban horizons . What a saga !
Nous Avons Fait Un Beau Voyage . . .	" Ciboulette " is primarily an operetta so if your cup of tea is , say , Mozart , Miles Davis or the Beatles , this might possibly bore you . For they sing every five minutes . To my ears , the only tune I find palatable is the lovely " Nous Avons Fait un Beau Voyage " . The story : Ciboulette is a market gardener in love with an idle noble man , Antonin . She's got eight fiancés and her uncle urges her to marry one of them as soon as possible . The director : Claude Autant-Lara who was first a set designer and it shows in " Ciboulette " . Autant-Lara would become one of the masters of the Cinema de Studio which the New Wavelet despised ( they did not know what they were missing ) and which produced masterpieces such as " Douce " ( 1943 ) or " L'Auberge Rouge " ( 1951 ) . The film begins with a long travelling on the sleepy city which ends up at a lamplighter . The settings and the costumes are dazzling . The " handkerchief scene " is filmed with delicacy : we see her reflection on a pond before a duck comes and blurs the picture . But it's strictly for Autant-Lara's completists . If you do not like operetta , you must move on .
a lacklustre comeback from " the Inconnus " but an entertaining comedy	In the French movie " the three brothers " ( 1995 ) , one of the characters says to the three members of the Inconnus : " Eh ! . . . Hurry up the Three Kings or it will cool down ! " It is to believe that this cue firmly fixed in their minds and gave them the idea to shot a movie . " The Three Kings " constitutes the Inconnus ' first collective opus since " the three brothers " ( " le pari " ( 1997 ) and " l'extra-terrestre " ( 2000 ) were made by two of them ) and because it is a comedy , they went straight to the point to make their public laugh . Indeed and very simply , the comic emanates from the dialogs . Besides , either it is a movie or a sketch , dialogs made the Inconnus ' success . Here , comical effects are created by the gap between the noble and archaic dialogs pronounced by the Three Kings and people's incredulous reactions who meet them and who of course consider them as fools . As a result , this comical device is easy but rather efficient and I would add monotonous . Indeed , this is nearly the sole one used during the whole movie and it makes it a little monotonous . There aren't many gags . Furthermore , by watching this zany story , it is difficult not to think about " the visitors " ( 1993 ) , the famous French film . Then , the story remains obscure on certain points , among this one : how do the Three Kings manage to travel through the time ? A rational explanation would have been apposite . " the Three Kings " remains a funny comedy in spite of its faults . The Inconnus ' fans should find something in it .
an honest horror movie . Starring Gabriel Byrne	The third movie produced by the production company " Dark Castle " and managed by Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis , " Ghost Ship " ( 2002 ) marks a step forward and constitutes a neat improvement in comparison with the two previous movies , " the House on the Haunted Hill " ( 1999 ) and " 13 Ghosts " ( 2001 ) . This can be checked at the level of a meticulous making and quite outstanding special effects . It is all the more positive as with " Ghost Ship " , we deal with a B movie . Another good point : the change of scenery . It is a judicious choice to have replaced the threadbare topic of the haunted house by the haunted ship . If the screenplay doesn't avoid all the Hollywood conventions , neither all the clichés of the horror film , the director Steve Beck makes up for it by shrouding his movie an atmosphere of mystery as soon as the crew discovers the ship . He's also imposing ( slowly but surely ) a progressive rise of the tension which reaches its climax in the end . The result : we come in for a few real moments of fright and Beck , in the long run puts the spectator in his pocket . As far as the cast is concerned , there are two surprises . First : Julianna Margulies who for once decided to give up scalpels in the " ER " series and especially Gabriel Byrne . An ambitious actor who isn't reluctant to sometimes act in a horror movie which is potboiler for him like " End of Days " ( 1999 ) or " Stigmata " ( 1999 ) . It is a shame that the end isn't really satisfying and suits badly to the whole . But no matter , " Ghost Ship " remains a nice little horror movie whose main function is to make shiver . For this , it reaches its goal . One last thing , if the movies that come out of the " Dark Castle " production company keep on gaining in quality , maybe will they create a masterpiece one day . . . NB : it borrows a bit from " shining " .
Ship of pools	The luxury liner " Normandie " is to sail across the Atlantic ocean . Destination New York . And I mean luxury : they have a nice swimming-pool I'd love to dive in . The passengers : the who's who of the French cinema of the forties : Gaby Morlay , Michel Simon , Claude Dauphin , Jules Berry . . . . Like in the disaster movies , there are many subplots most of them independent . The difference is that there is NO disaster ; do not expect a wreckage : the " Normandie " is not another " Titanic " . Some of the subplots : 1 ) A detective ( Simon ) is in charge of an invaluable diamond ; well , diamonds may be a girl's best friend , but this precious stone story is not the best thing in the movie . Disappointing ending . 2 ) A man travels with his missus and his secretary who is also his mistress . Against all odds , the two women become good friends . A menage à Trois well before Truffaut's " Jules and Jim " . 3 ) A poor journalist wants to meet again a girl he ' s known in France . But he discovers she is a rich girl and the papa says no to the union . One evening , dad disappears . What do you suppose that means ? Unlike the diamond stuff , the ending of this plot is a bit unexpected and makes sense . What the movie lacks is unity and a great writer . One can only wonder what Julien Duvivier and Henri Jeanson would have done with this subject .
Hush hush sweet Gwen !	If you take it for what it is , a feast of camp , then this movie ( and particularly Lange ) is much fun to watch . Probably influenced by Davis's ( see " hush hush sweet Charlotte " ) and Crawford's end of career ( see " straitjacket " ) , Jessica Lange gives an over the top performance of the bitchiest mother-in-law you can think of . Always a beaming smile on her face even when she ' s at her most sadistic . Her bubble head son seems not to have overcome his Oedipus complex ; when at the turning of the year , " Auld lang syne " is played , he dances with his mom . As for the wedding , he seems to marry her . Besides , being able to lead a normal life after what we learned from his " education " is hard to believe ; a boy like him would have normally ended up like cousin Sebastian in " Suddenly last Summer " . This extravaganza has also intellectual pretensions : in the church , Martha keeps on reciting her act of contrition while quoting the Ruth Book in the Bible ; in her troubled mind , her unfortunate daughter-in-law becomes Ruth , whose affection to mother-in-law Naomi reflects her own situation . If you're not a highbrow , and if you like old-fashioned cheesy melodramas " Hush " is made for you . If you're a " pulp fiction " fan , well , please pass by .
More Polanskian than Hitchcockian .	Beware of neighbors ! That's Rosemary's story , and that's the tenant's story , two great Polanski films . The camera tricks recall the Pole's style too . " Barracuda " could have been filmed stage drama , since we do not go out of Rochefort's flat , but the director manages to give a cinematographic feel to it . Clement's character is not that much original however : he is akin to Norman Bates and Chabrol's hero in " les fantômes du chapelier " ( 1982 ) . He has a fixation on Fred Astaire , and sometimes it's difficult to see the connection with what he does . When he captures and confines Luc , it works and it's suspenseful , but superficially . That's what's it's not really Hitchcockian : in the Master's greatest movies , the Freudian mother rules ( see " notorious " , " strangers on a train " , " psycho " , " the birds " " Marnie " ) What's lacking here is Clement's psychology : why does he do that ? because he wants a son ? because his solitude has become too unbearable ? because , he's grown embittered ? because he's a frustrated gay ? Except for his tastes for musicals , and his wife's death , we know absolutely nothing from Clement and it takes all Jean Rochefort's talent to make it credible . Guillaume Canet is very efficient too , and it was not an easy task to play opposite to such a veteran . " Barracuda " is no masterpiece , but it's an interesting movie for suspense buffs , and , in spite of an unsatisfying ending , it'll give you a good share of scares . And if a new neighbor invites you in , think twice . . . .
There are places I remember in my life . . . ( John Lennon )	" Dernières vacances " , although it retains a certain charm and it did introduce highly talented Odile Versois ( they were four sisters , all of Russian extraction ; for the record the three others were / are Marina Vlady ( the most popular ) , Olga Poliakoff and Hélène Vallier ) , has not worn that well . It depicts a very bourgeois milieu ( with the eventual exception of Juliette's father ) , very educated ( they talk about Latin when they are having lunch ) . The love " affairs " ( Juliette and an " old " real estate agent ; Juliette and Jacques who wants to prove he is a man ; and even Jacques and his auntie ) are conventional and rather bland . What can still move today's audience is these people's love ( even if they want to sell it ) for their old mansion which contains their dear past ( parents and old aunt ) , the places where they play hide and seek ( the young children ) or where they learn to grow up ( the teenagers ) . The film is actually a flashback : Jacques is in the classroom but he does not pay attention ; in his dreams he is far away , away in this house which means so many things to him . I'm not sure , however , that the last sentence is that true : " there are things you have got to learn on your own " , yes , but provided you have a good family to comfort you when blue turns to gray . . . The movie was certainly influential as far as the French cinema is concerned : - These " safe " romances would become the bulk of Eric Rohmer's " oeuvres " , where all young people have got to do is contemplate their navel . - More interesting , the auntie predates the free woman , a character present in Bertrand Tavernier's " Un Dimanche A la Campagne " ( Sabine Azema's role ) - In 1971 , Jean - Claude Brialy's first effort as a director , " Eglantine " , had a screenplay which was quite similar to that of " Dernières Vacances " .
Better reading the book .	The conclusion was taken from Christie's adaptation of her novel for the stage . Hence the big difference ! The biggest flaw of this passable suspense story lies in the characters : some of them have been downright ruled out : such is the case of Miss Brent , the old narrow-minded spinster ; she's turned into a sophisticated actress ! Anthony Marston the playboy becomes a singer played by a third-rate singer , Fabian . As for the others , they are much less interesting than on the paper : Ann Clyde ( = Vera Claythorne ) played by Goldfinger gorgeous golden girl Shirley Eaton , has not the guilt feeling she had in Christie's words . Hugh O ' Brian's Lombard ( Hugh instead of Philip , we wonder why ) has a love affair with her , probably to sweeten Christie's ruthless plot . Stanley Holloway's Blore and Wilfrid Hyde-White's mischievous judge easily steal the show . They had teamed up the year before in Cukor's " My fair lady " . The location in the mountains was not a bad idea and could successfullyreplace the famous island . At least , one scene is impressive : the domestic's escape on the cable-car . Unfortunately George Pollock ( Miss Marple series of the sixties ) is too academic a director to generate genuine thrills . Besides , 99 % of the people who watched , are watching or will watch this movie have already read the book , probably the best known detective story in the universe . So why complain if you're not surprised ? The version I saw did include the whodunit minute but I read it had been deleted since .
Stage fright	According to the Cahiers Du Cinema theory , Gilles Grangier was a mediocre director , cause he did not " innovate " . These hackneyed ideas do not stand up to hindsight . Cause Grangier did innovate in this movie : 1 ) He begins his movie with the end of a play , with all the actors bowing to the audience ! 2 ) The subject is eternal , still relevant today : a stage actor ( Daniel Gelin ) who generally plays secondary characters was a witness in a gangland killing . For him , opportunity knocks : he becomes a celebrity overnight and is given the great parts he has always been dreaming of . 3 ) But this nice guy is perhaps not so nice . Might it be perjury ? 4 ) The lines the actor delivers on stage , he could as well say them in real life , now that the gangster he sent to jail escaped and told him he would die within three days . Essentially a psychological thriller , where the gangsters work behind the scenes , " Trois Jours A Vivre " is a nice little flick .
The Anastasia syndrome .	Man ( Vanel ) comes back from WW1 and finds again his wife and kid ; he suffers from amnesia . As he is a wealthy notable , gossips surface . Is he really the man he claims to be ? There's a trial but he wins his case thanks to a mysterious person ( Berry ) who turns to be a blackmailer . Adapted from a Kafka novel ( not THE Kafka ) , this is an interesting work : Vanel portrays with conviction this bewildered man , in search of his identity . Best scene shows an old lady , chasing him out of her flat , saying he's not her son , then , when the door is closed , bursting into tears . Kurt Bernardt had begun his career in Germany , as contemporary of Lang and Murnau , but these works are almost impossible to see ( he directed Dietrich ) . Then , after a stint in France , he headed for America where he directed minor movies , most of them forgotten , including the remake of perennial French tear-jerker " le voile bleu " ( as " the blue veil " ) . Most interesting is the influence of the movie on later works : - In 1983 , Daniel Vigne directed " Le retour de Martin Guerre " . During the Middle Ages , a man comes back to his home . but is he really the one he claims to be ? Well you get the picture : a remake in disguise . - in 1992 , " Sommersby " was a remake of " Martin Guerre " ( actually the re-remake of " Carrefour " ) . WW1 , Middle Ages or American Civil war , it's the same old song .
You say you want a revolution . . .	. . . . but you come too soon . André Hugon made the first talkie in France ( " Les Trois Masques " , 1929 ) . His whole work has sunk into oblivion , but this " Gaspard de Besse " indicates that this is relatively unfair . A good adventure film featuring Raimu as a French Robin Hood's brother , " Gaspard de Besse " takes place in Provence in the years preceding the French Revolution . It depicts the dubious milieu of the " law " : the drunken judge's son and his friends hang an old man just for fun . So Gaspard , his brother and their band steal from the Rich and give to the Poor . Historic character Mirabeau - who was to play a prominent part in the events of 1789 - appears in one scene . The script is not always satisfying but there are witty lines and a rebellious mind all along the film . André Hugon " signed " his movie after the last picture .
Philippe Labro's first effort . .	. . . and his best . All that he made afterward can easily be dismissed as rubbish . A journalist - he also wrote words for some songs - he dreamed of the American cinema because he spent some of his youth on the other side of the pond . Actually , we're closer to Agatha Christie's whodunit than to American film noir . It's not a problem . It's better to have a good imitation of a detective story à la " and then there were none " than a pale reflection of Wise or Hawks . One by one , people who did something nasty in the past are slain and detective Trintignant is here to solve the mystery , a mystery which entertains the audience till the very end . Outside Trintignant , the cast is very odd , including French crooner Sacha Distel , as an emcee of a stupid radio contest ( a wonderful spoof ) , Segal , who wrote " love story " , Chabrol's then-wife ( and ex-wife of Trintignant ) and best actress Stephane Audran , Italian not yet sex symbol Laura Antonelli , here cast against type , Jean-Pierre Marielle . . . Very entertaining .
Escape from the Boulle planet .	Visually , this film is sometimes a splendor ; the light falls on a crepuscular world . The Apes ' town is quite scary particularly when you see it from a distance , as it stands out against an ominous sky . In the very beginning , the cast and credits are also successful , with an adequate martial music . The first third has some funny , parodic and sometimes politically incorrect lines . In the second third , the movie begins to lose steam , although the discovery in the wrecked spaceship is a rather good idea . But that's not all good news . First of all , the hero lacks charisma and the apes and their sensational make-up simply overwhelm him and drown him out . On the contrary , majestic Charlton Heston , even when he was in chains , displayed a Shakespearian grandeur in the first version . The last third consists in battles , a " second coming " and the " astonishing " ending without which . . that would not be " planet of the apes " . Actually , the new ending was borrowed from Pierre Boulle ' s novel , but not without adding a mathematically unlikelihood which will give you headaches if you begin to think too hard : the least they can do : Everything , even the proper nouns from the French writer's book have been removed , even if some characters recall some of the Boulle / Shaffner version . Shaffner had contented himself with changing the astronauts ' name ( eg : Ulysse Mérou = Taylor ) Hats off to Helena Bonham-Carter who brings warmth and emotion in a rather vapid cast : in a part close to that of Kim Hunter / Zira , she really asserts her distinctive identity . Tim Roth is effective as well , but his part is less so . David Warner and Kris Kristofferson are wasted . As a tribute to Shaffner ( ? ) both Linda Harrison ( an unidentified woman captured with Leo ) and Charlton Heston ( moaning his curse , which is , admittedly , funny ) appear unbilled . Tim Burton might be a director to remember . Although he has not made a genuine masterpiece yet , his filmography is already rich : " Sleepy hollow " , " Edward Scissorhands , the marvelous " Ed Wood " ( Martin Landau is unforgettable ) . But redoing " planet of the apes " was a hard task . Shaffner's movie followed a progression , it moved slowly , from the long introduction showing the three astronauts making their way across desolate landscapes to the stunning final shots with Heston and Harrison ' s roaming down by the sea . Remember how long it took Taylor to convince Zira he was a thinking man ! Here it seems natural to Ari almost as soon as she sees him , that Leo is no dumb idiot animal . And that's the last straw , even Tim Roth ( some kind of cross between Shaffner's Cornelius and a pulp fiction baddie ) pretty damn quickly believes too that that human is too clever for his own sake . Tim Burton's so-so remake epitomizes the dearth of good scripts . Pierre Boulle's book is a golden mine and one could have written a coherent story out of it , different from that of the first version . Why not , for instance , introduce the two " astronauts " whose scenes open and close it , and turn Leo's adventures into a flashback ? What about showing the love between the hero and the woman-animal ? And the son they had ? And the menace this son represented for the simian race ? All these ideas were left over by Shaffner's script writers and could have built a strong new tale . The main flaw lies in the human beings : here , they speak - English ! - , they can reason , they can swim ( ! ) , they are ( except for bubble head Warren ) clever , so why the hell did the apes tame them ?
Despite a hollywoodian ending . . .	. . . which mars the film a little , " the forgotten " is a good thriller . Excellent performances by Julianne Moore , as the distraught mom and Gary Sinise , as the suave quiet shrink . The movie is essentially a chase with echoes of the " twilight zone " series thrown in for good measure . There are really eerie scenes : Moore , discovering that her photo albums are empty and that her video tapes are blank ; the strange man who is everywhere ; the last scene with the husband who does not recognize his wife ; the night in the " Quest-Air " ( what a name ! ) building ; the heartbeat which beats the enemy at his own game . I would have preferred an open ending ; haven't we enough of those " moving " scenes with turgid music which we've seen a hundred times or more ? Forget the ending : it's the ideal present for Mother's Day for Moore's sensitive acting epitomizes the love a mother feels for her child . Only for that , the movie is worth watching .
break up the family . . .	Since the critical and commercial success of " Rushmore " ( 1998 ) , Wes Anderson became a promising and talented director . He's even nicknamed " Hollywood's new prodigy " . So three years after " Rushmore " , he released a new movie : " The Royal Tenenbaums " ( 2001 ) . This movie's got a whacky script ( the Tenenbaums are all gifted ) full of zany ideas and powerful cues : " he's not your father " says Gene Hackman to Gwyneth Paltrow about Danny Glover , " Neither you " she replies . But this on the level of the directing that Anderson's talent shines : it turns out to be inventive , clever and we can notice that he favors two devices : static shots and tracking shots . Moreover , it's obvious that Anderson put a lot of effort into the esthetic side of the movie : bright colors have been used on the sceneries and they're enhanced by a luminous photography . With all these advantages , " The Royal Tenenbaums " is a movie full of light and life . But in parallel , I thought that the performances were of varying quality : if Gene Hackman and Ben Stiller dominate the cast , on the other hand , Anjelica Huston and especially Gwyneth Paltrow make the movie a bit dull . Besides , her wild look annoyed me during nearly all the movie . I preferred her in " the talented Mr Ripley " ( 1999 ) . Moreover , given that she's a playwright , could she be Max Fischer's distant cousin ? ( Max Fischer was the hero of " Rushmore " and in his spare time , he wrote plays too ) . Then , I think I didn't understand one sequence : this is the last one when all the members of the Tenenbaum family are gathered to attend Hackman's funeral . What do they feel ? Happiness ? Sadness ? Indifference ? Wes Anderson doesn't really reveal us the members ' feelings about this dramatic event . Although , I don't really regard Wes Anderson as a genius , I'm obliged to recognize that he's got talent to produce movies which can be both funny and wit . So , once again : " the royal Tenenbaums " , a good movie ? Definitely . A masterpiece ? No .
Only angels have wings .	Released the same year as " Flesh " , this is much more " fordian " than the movie starring Wallace Beery . " Airmail contains the seeds of a lot of things which will be developed by the director afterward : manly friendship , sense of duty , struggle against the elements . And most of all , the fact that any man can redeem himself . There are such characters in the script : the first one is the pilot who , in the past , left his plane ( with passengers ) before the crash ; the second is Duke ( Pat O'Brien ) who falls first under a femme fatale's spell , then leaves her and comes to his mate's rescue , at his own risk . People often say that Ford's cinema is very optimistic . These ones have tunnel vision . There are a lot of deaths in this film : Joe ' s and " Dizzy " ' s ones are particularly dreadful . The men here are true heroes who give everything : Bellamy's character will face the storm , in spite of his lover's plea . " Only angels have wings " ( Hawks , 1939 ) would certainly be influenced by Ford whose interest in planes would not be dried up when he directed " The wings of eagles " in 1957 .
Unfairly overlooked .	Serge Leroy has never been a great director but this one is arguably his best . A group of notables go hunting in the woods . A young girl ( Mimsy Farmer , who was the star of " More " ) , becomes their victim . " La traque " ( tracking ) is not a misnomer cause the girl is tracked down all along the movie which includes violence and murder . It could have been an umpteenth version of " the most dangerous game " , it is actually much more . Leroy beats Chabrol at his own game when he shows , as his colleague perhaps never did , how the bourgeois can get away with complete impunity . A solid cast , featuring some of the best actors of the time ( Mickael Lonsdale , Jean-Pierre Marielle , Paul Crauchet , Michel Constantin . . ) gives the characters substance . And Claude Renoir's cinematography brilliantly enhances the silvan landscapes where the unfortunate heroine runs for her live .
Night for day .	François Truffaut had always despised his French colleague André Cayatte . When he was a journalist , he used to pan him as hell ! And what's funny lays in the fact that " day for night " ressembles " Les Amants de Verone " , a movie by . . . André Cayatte ( 1948 ) So , 25 years after Cayatte , the " modern " Truffaut bestows on us " a movie in the movie " ! Well , " la nuit americaine " has a certain spontaneity , a friendly side , some good actors-Jacqueline Bisset is the stand - out , beautiful and efficient , Jean-Pierre Aumont , Alexandra Stewart in a cameo - , but some atrocious ones - Jean-Pierre Léaud , certainly less unbearable when dubbed in English , Tina Aumont , hysterical and theatrical , Bernard Menez , generally relegated to dumb French comedies . François Truffaut is dynamic , he believes in what he's doing , but he seems smug , brimming with self-esteem . Just compare his act with his modest but wonderful portrayal of Doctor Itard in " l'enfant sauvage " . Neither the " real story " not the screenplay ( Meet Pamela ) are really astounding , Truffaut intertwines them with gusto , and he effectively gives spice to it with cinebuff references . The " little-child-I-was " black and white shots are overkill . They are redundant and pretentious : dreamlike scenes are not Truffaut's forte .
Elysees fields forever !	Let Guitry take you down cause he's going to . . . Elysées fields . . . where nothing is real ( isn't it ? ) and nothing to get hung about . . Champs Elysées forever ! This movie belongs to Guitry's historical movies ; such works include " les Perles de la Couronne " ( 1937 ) and the two magnus opus " Si Versailles M'Etait Conté " ( 1953 ) and " Si Paris Nous Etait Conté " ( 1955 ) ; there were three more movies but they were minor ( " le Mot De Cambronne " ) or academic ( " Napoleon " ) . As for " De Jeanne D'Arc à Petain " , made during the occupation days ( 1942 ) let's draw a veil over it , if only out of respect for the artist and let's remember his very first film " Ceux De Chez Nous " , the true granddaddy of all Guitry's historical extravaganzas . " Remontons les Champs Elysées " fills its quota of puns , gags and hilarious situations as well as useful " inventions " : the 2-person guillotine Marat is very interested in is not the least . IT all began under Marie de Medicis's regency when Concini ( a nasty Italian : why , complains Guitry , do French always choose treacherous aliens to rule ? ) was the real master : les Champs Elysees were then just a large path through the wood where young Louis 13th , sick and tired of his minister , achieved a right and left : a boar and the infamous wop . May this movie the director's claim for immortality ? the story is told by a schoolteacher ( Guitry who plays other parts ) in front of his pupils : one of them is his own son , and he's the son of the kings , of Napoleon and of the Republic ! How Guitry succeeds in proving such a far-fetched story is his secret ! A transparent metaphor for the French citizen as he is today ? Or the artist's desire longing for immortality ? But Guitry has a darker side to him : the fear of death . One of the segments is revealing : a two-bit fortune teller told the king Louis 15th he would die six months after the marquis de Chauvelin ; so the monarch sends all his sawbones to the noble man to take care of his health ; he puts him on a diet because " if you die , my own days will be numbered " . there's also this obsession of dying when you are 64 : " when you are 20 , and you know you're going to die when you're sixty-four , you've got plenty of time ; but when you turn sixty-three , you are not smiling anymore " . This obsession with death was even more obvious in the two final historical works : the best segment of " Si Versailles . . . . " deals with the final years of the Sun King , growing old along Madame De Maintenon ; as for " Si Paris . . . . " , it shows many old people , among them Voltaire dying . . . Guitry opened up in his movies : proof positive he was a genuine artist .
Dark as a dungeon .	" le Point Du Jour " did not look like the other movies of the era . There are no principals , no real plot and it's centering on the mine itself . No melodrama , no disaster , most of the time it's the miners ' daily life ; their day begins " Au Point Du Jour " ( at daybreak ) and most of them seem happy . Only a little boy wants to get out of this place and his mother does not seem to understand him ; his sister suggests he learn another job , but oddly , as she has given him a compass for his fourteenth birthday , that he may feel like studying does not cross her mind . What's really strange ( and quite disturbing for today's audience ) is that these people do not realize their sons and daughters could ask for more . It's remarkable that the long flashback ( which comes out of the blue ) shows that the class struggle is a thing of the past and so are strikes - now that the miners have gone in France , there are still strikes ! - . The ending is even more intriguing and it reminds one of that of " Metropolis " ( 1926 ) . Capital ( represented by a young engineer ) and labor will walk hand in hand for the sake of the production . It does not put a question mark over Daquin's competence . But his vision is somewhat biased , influenced by communist ideology . That a miner can be proud of his job is legitimate . However , boiling down the problems of the minors to a ( gentle ) conflict between an old executive ( René Lefevre ) who treats the miners like soldiers and a young " human " one ( Jean Desailly ) is quite simplistic . A very young Michel Piccoli appears as the boy's sister's fiancé .
A lot of fun ! !	This movie looks like an erotic comic strip of the sixties . Today , it's priceless delightful trash . If you have a chance to see it - which is not easy - do not think twice . It could be the granddaddy of " pulp fiction " " Texas chain saw massacre " or " Born killers " with more humor than the three former works put together . The three girls act like men , they do not seem to like them - with the exception of the " vegetable " whom they despise anyway - . There ' re probably in love with bubble head girl Linda ( they are caricatures of the dyke in the imagination of narrow-minded people ) who spends the whole movie in bikini and whom they bind and gag with an intense pleasure ! ( Tarentino might have found the excellent bikini scene with Juliette Lewis in " from dusk till dawn " here ) . They meet a family who lives in the desert . And what a family ! a crippled ( but wealthy ) father in a wheelchair , a dumb muscle man son and another son , a two-bit hero . Russ Meyer parodies the " intellectual " westerns and the Freudian thrillers of the forties ! And even " Hud " ! Hercules cannot stand the sound of the train , and his father hates women : what do you suppose THAT means ? There's an explanation ! When I started watching " faster pussycat kill kill " , I did not expect anything ! It's not to be taken literally . But if you want something drastically different , I would never recommend it enough .
all Victor Meynard has to do is to kill Renée Darieux	Victor Meynard ( Jean Rochefort ) is a seasoned , aging contract killer with a hesitant sexuality , under his mother's thumb . But his future could be symbolized by a young , naive dispatch rider Antoine ( Guillaume Depardieu ) whom he wants to initiate to his job . For his next contract , he has to kill a young female thief , Renée Darieux ( Marie Trintignant ) who is hunted down by a gang of baddies but unplanned circumstances lead him to protect her and to take refuge in his house . Victor is torn down between two alternatives : should he fulfill his pledges and get rid of Renée or should he let love prevail for her ? Pierre Salvadori may be a minor director , his films bear the mark of a personal work with nothing intellectual or pretentious in them and they should deserve more recognition in the guide of films by Jean Tulard in which each of his efforts has only one star out of four . " Cible Emouvante " has enough valuable assets to justify its screening . First , Salvadori's first effort eschews in the major part of the film , an ultra-mapped master plan and is straddling several genres . Thus , the onset of the film might let the viewer think that the film will be based on the formation of Antoine to the job by Victor . But later , the director changes way and follows the three main characters trying to escape the Casa Bianca gang who runs after Renée . The two gangs will rub shoulders in a chic hotel . And finally , Salvadori steers his work on another way when Victor , Antoine and Renée wind up in Victor's house . Investigations from the Casa Bianca gang , chases and suspense take a back seat and perhaps the chief key of the film is Victor's personality . This man goes through emotional turmoil and doesn't know how to come to terms with Antoine and Renée who force him to question himself about his job and his life . These different directions deftly mesh without major clumsiness . Pierre Salvadori wields black humor and maintains laughter thanks to a shrewd scenario in which he weaves preposterous , hilarious sequences . And he eschews some predictable moments through unexpected schemes . And let's not forget potent cues . At last , a delineation of the characters contributes to the pleasure of the film between the finally fragile Victor , the naive Antoine and the neurotic Renée . Guillaume Depardieu and Marie Trintignant will meet again in the director's two subsequent works : " les Apprentis " ( 1995 ) and " Comme Elle Respire " ( 1998 ) . Don't expect something astounding but a gratifying , refreshing black comedy with a sense of unpredictable .
The red earth of Harrow .	Another melodrama by one of the giants of the genre . I think the story does not really takes off in its first part . Gambling and Amorous Quarrel again and again . If it were not for Maureen O'Hara or Rex Harrison , it would be downright boring . But the second part , after the wedding , is much more exciting : it looks like , relatively speaking , the second part of " Gone With the wind " ( Rhett , Scarlett , the child , the dear valuable property , even Belle Watling ) with a dash of " Uncle Tom's cabin " thrown in for good measure : it's really too bad that the part of Belle should be so underwritten ; her rebel stand was so necessary in this yessir world . She is the equivalent of Eliza in Mrs Beecher-Stowe's book but she was not as lucky as her . This second part is the descent into hell , for husband and wife have lost almost everything and they have got to pick up the pieces .
When the time comes . . .	It was the second time Ophüls had broached an historical subject ( unless we count " Lola Montès " ) . In France 1939 , he filmed the tragic love story of Franz Ferdinand and Countess Sophie Chotek , of course a misalliance , hence a Morganatic marriage . As it did not happen as Charles Stuart was concerned , the lovers are left with memories ( " I'll visit you in your dreams " ) . If it weren't for the last minutes , the film would not be a real Max Ophüls ( spelled " Opuls " ) movie . The last third is a bit Curtizesque , Douglas Faibanks Jr recalling Erroll Flynn . This is certainly a good film , but it cannot be included in the director's best works such as " Liebelei " " La Signora Di Tutti " " Letters from an unknown woman " or " Madame De " . This is fictionalized history - whereas " De Mayerling A Sarajevo " depicted real events - where the round heads ( the Puritans ) , dressed in black nicely play the parts of the villains against a noble hero dressed in white . There are good lines ; I particularly like this one " If I ever come home , I shall belong to no party " . Another good moment : " He lives in luxury and idleness " say the Puritans ( a picture shows the " farm worker " plowing ; " He must be ready to kill " ( the man and his girl see the new-born chicks ) Maria Montez is the " star " of the film but her appearance does not exceed ten / fifteen minutes . It's Holland as we imagine it : windmills ( with an impressive duel on it ) , tulips , canals , fair-haired girls . . .
Alice Carroll in wonderland .	Few people know this Chabrol movie and I agree with the precedent users : it's a work that deserves to be restored to favor . Almost unique in the director's canon , it deals with the fantastic genre : only the final sequences of " la rupture " ( 1970 ) verge on it . Its less - than - critically - acclaimed reception led Chabrol to ditch that new direction , which was perhaps too bad , considering the big amount of mediocre films he made afterward . Probably influenced by American B movie " carnival of souls " ( 1962 ) and Louis Malle's " black moon " ( 1975 ) , " Alice " walks a fine line that directly leads to works such as " Jacob's ladder " ( 1990 ) " a pure formality " ( 1994 ) and " the sixth sense " ( 1999 ) . Sylvia " Emmanuelle - Krystel is not much of an actress , but it does not matter here because it's the atmosphere which counts : a green green landscape , where Chabrol achieves the incredible feat of exuding anguish in the daylight , a gloomy mansion where , when you talk on the phone , your own voice echoes you ; a strange library where the heroine finds a BOrges book-and it's no coincidence - Jorge Luis Borges's " ficciones " ( one of his short stories is called " El jardin de Sanderos que se bifurcan " : the garden with paths which fork ) , Borges whose spirit literally haunts the movie . The party where the guests celebrate " my sister's death " displays Luis Bunuel's influence , notably " the phantom of liberty " ( 1974 ) A very strange supporting cast " plays " with the heroine , and their behavior predates David Fincher's " the game " by more than twenty years : Charles Vanel and Fernand Ledoux , whose careers began during the silent era , Jean Carmet , Andre Dussolier , playing two parts , dressed in white then in black and showing one more time Hitchcock's stranglehold on Chabrol's cinema when he says " the world is a pigpen , isn't it ? " as Uncle Charlie in " shadow of a doubt " ( 1942 ) . What will you find on the other side of the mirror ? Sorry . . . of the wall ? And when there's no wall anymore ? " Alice ou la dernière fugue " should appeal to Chabrol's fans even if it's not really chabrolesque .
guess who's coming to dinner . . .	The adaptation of plays for the screen goes right for the French cinema as the enormous success of " le diner de cons " ( 1998 ) and " 8 femmes " ( 2002 ) testified . It is not this first movie from the pair Jaoui / Bacri that will prove the contrary . Based on a very successful play written by the quoted couple , there are at least 3 good reasons not to miss this excellent comedy of manners . First , Agnès Jaoui , the director took more liberty in comparison with the play to diversify the place of the action . This , in order to avoid filmed stage production . A major part of the movie takes place in the kitchen but Jaoui preferred to take her camera in other rooms like the corridors or children's bedroom . Secondly , the director just hired a handful of actors . But with actors like Jean Pierre Bacri or Jean Pierre Darroussin ( who won an Oscar in France in 1994 for his performance ) , you are nearly sure to have a really good time . Trust me . Thirdly , brilliant dialogs which reveal the tandem Bacri / Jaoui's big talent give the movie a strong appeal . As soon as we are in the kitchen and from the first cues , you can feel that this party is bound to fail . It begins with nearly trite complaints : " the guests are late " or " the dishes are too salted " but the scriptwriters go further and use their dialogs as a way to unmask their characters . Gradually , tension grows , arguments break out , what is left unsaid prevails and you guess wasted lives , hidden dark secrets or poor existences . In the end , the spoiled party , the rancors are mainly brought on by the most important character of the play : a childhood friend who has become a host TV . you hear about him all night long but we never see him . With these three assets , it would be out-of-place to reject this delightful comedy . Let's regret just one detail : the scenery of the kitchen seems extracted from a sitcom due to gaudy colors . It is however the seminal place of the plot . Fortunately , the power of words and the actors ' game are strong enough to forget this shortcoming .
The invisible boy	In Cukor's " Women " ( 1939 ) the heroines talked about men we never saw cause it was an all-female cast . In " Edward My Son " , the character of the title , " Edward " never appears either . It may be interesting but it's also a bit infuriating cause we know him only through the others ' conversations . It takes all the talent of the cast to make the movie worthwhile : Spencer Tracy , whose love for his spoiled child knows no bounds and leads him to become selfish , tyrannical and even crooked ; Deborah Kerr , who for the first and last time in her career is compelled to overplay in her last scenes : the aristocratic Kerr as an alcoholic shrew , it has to be seen to be believed ! The movie is a long flashback : Tracy appears in the first sequence and tells the audience he just lost his only child ; he owns almost everything a man can , and perhaps the theater where you are watching this film ; he will come back for the epilogue . Although not entirely satisfying , it's an interesting way of telling a story , which ventures off the beaten track .
we wish Lino Ventura a happy new year	Claude Lelouch is known for having left a copious filmography behind him and in which very few films reach the scale of the masterwork , except maybe " un Homme et Une Femme " ( 1966 ) and " la Vie , l'Amour , la Mort " ( 1969 ) . A good proportion is to be pigeonholed in the category of entertaining , homespun films and " la Bonne Année " has its place among them . Straddling between two genres : the gangster movie and the sentimental movie , the Lelouch 1973 vintage features Lino Ventura who is released from prison for the new year in 1968 and with a little help from his accomplish plans to commit a break-in to a jeweler's . But in parallel , he falls in love with a lovely female antique dealer . These two types of cinematographic genres are difficult to handle together but as we are in Lelouch's universe you've got to accept the rules of the game . And the cohesive transition between them works thanks to Lelouch's fluid making and with a lot of humor going for it . I especially love the sequences when he dresses up as an old , rich man who visits the jeweler's and talks about his sister who is at hospital in a serious state . The steps of the operation are shot with clarity and precision . One also appreciates Lino Ventura's mischievous performance and the fact that Lelouch managed to subdue some superfluous features pertaining to him which aren't too overwhelming and are even funny to the pleasure of the projection . So , you can forgive the filmmaker for having incorporated pseudo-philosophical dialogs between Ventura and his female partner about love , wedding and the stability of the couple as well as being amused by a little juggling of the color and black and white concerning the cinematography . The outset and the end are shot in black and white , probably to give an arty feeling to the film even if one can deem this action as gratuitous . But never mind , if you've got to list the ten most watchable films in Lelouch's work , this one should be part of it .
Run silent run deep .	SPOILERS " Logan's run belongs to the " old intellectual " sci-fi that will come to an end pretty damn quick with the " new harmless " sci-fi inaugurated by the " Star Wars saga " . Not that " Logan's run ' is that much " food for thought " but its spirit harks back to " planet of the apes " " on the beach " or " THX1138 " . The novel from which it's adapted is almost totally betrayed , the film keeping nothing from its second part but the proper nouns ( Sleuth Francis playing a role almost diametrically opposite to the one he plays in the movie ) . Needless to say , the meat is to be found in the first part . " The Carousel " scenes are still impressive today ; and it's a rather smart metaphor : these promises of " to be born again in another body after your execution " make us think of all the old religious precepts . It's a totalitarian system , where the dictator is replaced by a computer . And no population problem : when you're 30 , the Carousel is waiting for you . The second part goes astray . The DC discovery has a déjà vu flavor . Indeed , the scenarists wanted to bestow a big surprise on the spectators , à la " planet of the apes " . But they fell short of their goal , and Peter Ustinov is wasted . Contrary to " intellectual sci-fi movies " , this one has an optimistic conclusion : a full circle actually , back to the roots , men and women are en route for our good old society , now that Francis , keeper of the " dom society " , has been killed . . . . With the pole of the American flag . A whole symbol .
Mother and son .	Not a prequel to Psycho ; a sequel to " strangers on a train " or " notorious " more like ! The over possessive mother was present long before the 1960 masterpiece in Hitchcock's canon . Madeleine Robinson , more than Belmondo , is the stand-out . She won the Volpi Cup and she really deserved it . Her portrayal of the bourgeois mother , more pitiful than really maleficent relegates the rest of the cast to walk-ons . The treatment is certainly HItchcockian , particularly in the second half . We know the name of the criminal twenty minutes before the ending ; Thus Chabrol avoids the " whodunit " which A . H . did not like either . Abetted by Henri - " Plein Soleil " ( M . Ripley ) René Clément , same year-Decae ' s sensational cinematography and inventive use of colors , particularly in the scenes in the country ( flowers , trees , brook ) and in Leda's apartment during the murder , he takes what is primarily a bourgeois drama out of the living-rooms . The mother is the " villain " of the movie but I do not think that Chabrol wanted us to like the other ones : Belmondo and his pal are scroungers ; as for the father , the simple fact that he cannot see his son's tragedy ( and that he can't even forgive him for what he's done ! ! ! ) makes him an irresponsible unpleasant man . An attack against the bourgeoisie was not that much new : even if he introduces " nouvelle vague " characters , if you know the pre-nouvelle vague FRench cinema , you will notice how much , unlike Truff , God ' et al , Chabrol owes a lot to Decoin , Clouzot , Duvivier , and Louis Daquin whose " Voyageur de la Tousssaint " already possessed almost everything which is in " a Double Tour " . In " A double Tour " , his first thriller , Chabrol is still prisoner of his American influence . Besides the elements of pure " nouvelle vague " - the long prologue with Bernadette Laffont at her window , the two pals ' boozing - get in the way . He is still a creator-in-waiting , and when he finds the perfect atmosphere , the perfect actress and the perfect musician , he will give his late sixties / early seventies masterful works such as " La Femme Infidèle " " Le Boucher " " la Rupture " or " Juste Avant la Nuit " . " A double Tour paved a reliable way to those future achievements .
Fin de decade depression blues .	A true anomaly in the French cinema , this despairing work has no equivalent in the contemporary production . One would rather have to look on the side of Louis Malle's " le feu follet " ( 1963 ) ( the fire within ) to find something not completely unlike Harel's effort . Wry and cynical , having lost all his illusions , the hero , a computer scientist , has got no more reason to live . Absolutely none . Estranged from the human race , he seems to live his life as some kind of entomologist , studying his colleagues . One of them catches his attention : Tisserand-José Garcia plays the most demeaning part of the decade - . Then Tisserand will become some kind of prey : all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man . The scene is the night-club climaxes the strange relationship : the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he . . . . Well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak ( Clouzot's misanthropy maybe ) but just for a while . The form is weird beyond comment There are two voices-over , one for the narrator who always refers to the main character as " our hero " , one for the aforementioned hero . The story takes place , now in Paris , now in Rouen , Guy de Maupassant's town . In a scene with his shrink , the hero says the writer's madness was only the expression of his disgust for Man and he draws a parallel between his despair and Maupassant's one . This depressing movie is only suitable for an informed audience . Not for the very short excerpts of X-rated movies , but because after watching it , you may be feeling down in the dumps .
unknown code = no access to any life	Paris , in the year 2000 . A thoughtless gesture ( a scrap of paper thrown in the hands of a beggar ) causes a general altercation . As a matter of fact , the Austrian film-maker Michael Haneke goes from this incident to relate bits of various characters ' lives . There's among others , Anne ( Juliette Binoche ) , an actress who travels from movie to movie . Her husband , Georges a war photographer whose photos express pain and suffering from the countries he visited . Jean who fled from his father's farm in the north of France to come to Paris . Amadou who works in an institute for deaf and dumb children and Maria , a Romanian woman who has trouble to make ends meet by begging . Like " 71 Bits " ( 1994 ) , Haneke's movie is a patchwork of sequences shot in real time and interrupted with short black screens to have a break and in the same time to think about the sequence shot we have just seen . Shortly before the incident when Jean wants to go to Anne's flat , the latter tells him the code of her flat : " if you want to enter my flat , the code of my building is B4718 " . I'm not sure whether it's the right code but the building could epitomize a metaphor of a man's life . Every man's life is similar to a building kept generally by a code . The title of the film is rather easy to understand . The famous " unknown code " is a blocked access to any character's real life . This code is unknown for the strangers who surround him or her and as a consequence they don't known anything of his or her real life . It's this situation that is represented in Haneke's movie . On the surface , " Unknown Code " seems more breathable than Haneke's previous works and looks like a " Magnolia " ( 1999 ) à la Francaise . Michael Haneke juxtaposes different characters'different lives belonging to different social classes . They have apparently nothing in common except maybe that their own lives are kept by this unknown code for the others . However , they are affected by terrible sorrows which paralyze the Western society without this latter realizes it . In this Haneke's opus , there's neither the uppercut of " Benny's video " ( 1992 ) , nor the icy violence of " Funny Games " ( 1997 ) but through an accurate study of these different journeys , a quiet , impressive of rigor making , the director offers a disillusioned and black vision of this society . So , he remains faithful to his favorite topics : the difficulty of communication ( Amadou who tries to explain in a clumsy way his anger in front of Jean's unconsidered gesture ) . The way in which violence has become a feature of everyday life in a society which has become insensible to it ( we can remember perfectly the sequence shot when Anne irons , she can hear shrill cries near her . She hesitates then resumes to iron ) . The omnipresence of racism and the insurmountable barrier of social classes ( the scene in the tube is a grievous example ) . They are serious topics that are generally way off cinema's regular radar . It takes all Haneke's courage to explore them . Something he has relentlessly done since " the Seventh Continent " ( 1989 ) . So , " Unknown Code " is a logical extension of Haneke's obsessions . To come back to the characters , they feel either humiliated either difficulties to communicate . When it crosses our minds that we live inside this distressing universe , it sends shivers down our spines . Once again Herr Haneke stirred some of the viewers's deep fears . So , ultimately , " Unknown Code " isn't as accessible as Haneke's other works by its nonexistent linear narration and the seriousness of its theses but I think that it's a winner in Haneke's work . Of course , to watch a movie that breaks narrative conventions and expresses deeply pessimistic things is not for all tastes and that's partly why there'll never be general agreement about the famous Austrian film-maker but at least this movie brings to the light of day , thorny subjects hidden in the obscurity of cinema . It is a worthy movie far better than Hneke's next opus , " the Pianist " ( 2001 ) but that's another story . . .
the possessed child round 2	For a lot of cine buffs , the masquerade of " the Exorcist " ( 1973 ) was deemed ground-breaking enough to consider this enticing fantastic film to be a benchmark in the horror / fantasy genre but I'm not one of them . Three years later , " the Omen " steps into the breach William Friedkin's standard ( for the ones who are fans of it ) opened and the detractors of the film will surely qualify it as a pale mimicry of Friedkin's film , I will definitely choose Richard Donner's work which is perhaps the finest of all his career . A filmography often characterized by action-packed stories , the likes of the " Lethal Weapon " saga . So , Donner uses again some ingredients which made the success of " the Exorcist " like the child possessed by Satan who worries his surroundings and turns them to his advantage . First , it was a shrewd idea to have located the story in the American political milieu because it prepares the final sequence and the most famous one of the whole movie with sardonic humor : Damien holding the hand of the American president and grinning at him . Evil entering the White House and as the USA is the most powerful country in the world , the latter is in jeopardy . Apocalypse now indeed . . . As for the story , it is shot in a thrifty style . Would-be chilling special effects which plagued Friedkin's film and made it farcical weren't among Donner's priorities when he shot his film . So , special effects are kept to the minimum . It doesn't mean that " the Omen " is a total masterwork . Donner has a conspicuous taste for easy effects like the death of Damien's mother and his conventional directing sometimes stops the viewer from feeling shivers in some spooky sequences . Conventional could also be the most adequate epithet to deem the storyline as a whole . But these weaknesses don't handicap too much the thrill of the vision and as I said before : a ton of special effects wasn't Donner's priority and in spite of the scheduled dramatic progression , the film is eminently watchable . So " the Omen " is a more than valuable effort than its elder brother about the child haunted by Satan . If " the Exorcist " hadn't been created , maybe Donner's film could have had the stance of yardstick . And like its elder brother , this variation of the possessed child made crowds flock to it and caused a chain of cheesy sequels and even a remake which opened on the 06th June 2006 in the world . The choice of the date is evident . What about its quality ? I will talk about it in my review devoted to it on this site .
Satan accepted Kevil Lomax's soul . . .	American justice has always been at the heart of many American films . A lot of them have showed lawyers as main protagonists who defend victims with respect of justice . " The Devil's Advocate " ( 1997 ) which presents a new and worthy variation on the myth of Faust exploits an idea we have rarely seen on the screen : a lawyer ready to do anything to succeed , even to defend doubtful cases . Moreover , if the supernatural is an integral part of the whole , we can expect to watch a promising movie . So , here's the story : Keanu Reeves acts a young and ambitious lawyer , Kevin Lomax who can pride himself of not having lost a sole trial throughout his career . One day , he gets in touch with a prestigious law firm in New York run by the charismatic and mysterious John Milton ( Al Pacino ) who offers him a golden job doubled with a comfortable income . Of course , Lomax doesn't think twice before accepting and so he leaves his natal Florida with her bride Mary-Ann ( Charlize Theron ) to live in New York . After this , the young lawyer thinks he has reached the top but in the meantime , doubt gnaws away at him until he discovers terrible truths : he has defended criminals , his private life is broken and Milton's real identity will reveal itself before his eyes . If I'm not totally satisfied with " the Devil's Advocate " , it's because I think the outcome is largely telegraphed . Besides , even before seeing the movie , you can guess how it is going to end : the title and especially the cover speak volume about the conclusion : a benevolent Al Pacino taking Keanu Reeves under his wing . In another extent , if I look into the movie's references I realize that they are echoes of " Angel Heart " ( 1987 ) by Alan Parker and the story heavily borrows from " Rosemary's Baby " ( 1968 ) Roman Polanski's masterpiece . Indeed , Charlize Theron's attitude is strongly reminiscent of Mia Farrow's . And just look at the big and somewhat disturbing apartment in which she and Reeves settle . It resembles a lot to the one in " Rosemary . . . " . But on the other hand , " the Devil's Advocate " will influence a few forthcoming movies like " End of Days " ( 1999 ) . In spite of all , I don't intend to slag " the Devil's Advocate " off . The director Taylor Hackford well fulfilled his pledges and delivers , here a well-crafted thriller in spite of the foreseeable nature that clutters it up . As for the scriptwriters , they don't do properly one of their main jobs which is to write a suspenseful script as much as possible . There are also a few holes and one can judge the last images as a little incoherent with the rest of the story . But the authors make up for it by favoring a slow but sure rise of anxiety through Reeves ' descent into hell marked out by Theron's progressive madness . And by delaying as much as possible the final revelation , they hold the viewer breathless all the time of the movie . And concerning the dialogs , let's hail some well found cues ( I am an humanist ! ) . Among the other qualities we can attribute to Hackford's movie : a good use of secondary characters like Lomax's mother . We could expect her to occupy a decorative part and however her role is indispensable to light and to understand certain points of the story . In another extent , " the Devil's Advocate " is supported by a very careful photography which confers the movie a strong visual appeal , notably through New York's buildings and the interior of Milton's law firm as big as the devastating corruption which reigns in them . To a second degree , Hackford's movie can be read as a biting denunciation of the American judicial system's abuses and injustices . This critic is directed at unscrupulous lawyers carried away by success and money and ready to defend accused people guilty of a more or less serious offense who are eventually acquitted . In this way , Hackford's bitter critic kicks the bull's eye and at the end of the movie , there's a quite relevant morals which aims a positive objective . At last , about the cast , there's nothing to say about Al Pacino , the role of Satan suits him well and concerning Keanu Reeves , it is his second best performance to date after " Matrix " ( 1999 ) . So , " the Devil's Advocate " ( 1997 ) isn't free from shortcomings but the above-mentioned positive aspects are eloquent to make you want to watch this film .
We are not helpless .	It's strange how this Wise movie influenced " Invasion of the body snatchers " . The construction is exactly the same : a car belting with a couple inside : close shots on their faces , full of fear . They take refuge in a police station , and the man begins his story which he records on a tape . Like in " body snatchers " , there's a description of Kennington , a peaceful town , but little by little , the witness , a journalist , reveals us what lies beneath . And by the way , in 1945 , Wise made a movie called " the body snatcher " ! The town seems to be under Sirak's thumb , a local tycoon who has a hand in shady and illegal business . The police is totally corrupted , and , it's the last analogy with " Body snatchers " , ordinary people seem contaminated too ( the car salesman ) , or about to be ( the journalist's partner ) . A private eye tried to spill the beans , but he was murdered soon after having asked for the journalist's help . The murder scene is masterfully directed by Wise whose editing science is astounding : the private , driven back against a dead end street , in a symphony of black and white , by a mysterious car which will come back as an ominous messenger of death , then , abruptly , a trumpet bellowing out in a nightclub . Violence always takes place in the night , in Wise ' s world ( remember the end of " odds against tomorrow " , or even the rumble in " west side story " ) . The characters are realistic to a fault . No stereotype , no real baddie ( except for the gangsters whom we hardly see ; their presence can be felt everywhere though , that is to say how great Wise is ! ) It seems that Sirak is actually overtaken by events . Characters of secondary importance are wonderfully depicted : Sirak's wife , whom we see only twice in the movie appears at first as an indifferent woman , then , a fearful , pitiful one , an alcoholic at that . The main message of the movie is that we are not helpless , as the private detective's wife told the journalist soon after her husband ' s death . If the gangsters took over the town , it's because of people ( ordinary people ) who are too afraid of getting mixed up in a fight against the strong and the mighty , or worse , because bribes make ends meet . In 1952 , with no star , a low budget , and a great modesty , Wise showed the way to modern film noir .
conspiracy theory	Amid a patchy filmography cluttered with works besmirched with extreme visual effects " Carrie " ( 1976 ) , " Scarface " ( 1983 ) , " Body Double " ( 1984 ) , " Blow Out " effortlessly takes its place in the category of winners in Brian De Palma's work . It means that the filmmaker managed to refrain its penchant for the embarrassing features I mentioned and to produce a polished film . A film that bears its author's trademark . John Travolta acts a sound engineer , Jack Terry who accidentally recorded a car accident but further investigation reveals the evidence of a murder . Because he knows too much , he's in danger of his life and has to act all alone to be saved . The hero who has to manage all alone in a hostile world is a recurrent theme in De Palma's work and once again the filmmaker displays his technical master with brilliance with suspenseful moments of the right bottle in the bargain . If the influence of Sir Alfred Hitchcock is as glaring as in several of his previous movies , the filmmaker also found inspiration in Michelangelo Antonioni's celebrated " Blow Up " ( 1966 ) and in some famous conspiracy movies like Francis Ford Coppola's " the Conversation " ( 1974 ) or Alan J . Pakula's " the Parallax View " ( 1974 ) . But all these influences are subdued and mixed with De Palma's thematic and technical obsessions to produce a genuine work . That said , " Blow Out " isn't as intense as the quoted works because it doesn't avoid the filmmaker's limits : true , bombastic gratuitous effects are virtually absent but the scenario is sometimes given a rough side , notably in the middle of the film that seems fuzzy by moments and the psychology of the characters remains sketchy . Jack's demeanor sometimes remains a little incoherent which stops Travolta's performance to be startling . See it anyway , De Palma's stunning camera work will make you accept this work .
God said to Abraham : kill me a son !	Antisemitism has come a long way since " gentleman's agreement " ( 1947 ) . Kazan's attempt seems rather timid and tame today . " The believer " sets the record straight . It's one of the most convincing works in the field . It's all the more disturbing as the hero is a Jew joining the neonazis . And his behavior stems from his own education , his rebellion against the Torah : Abraham did really kill his own son , the Jew was made to comply with God's commandments ; the hero finds similarities between the Nazis's and the Jews's beliefs ; both are the Chosen ones . What puzzles me is the fact that he wants to annihilate the Jews , but he stills reads ( and respects ) the Bible ( One shall not be naked in front of it for flesh is impure ) . His arguments are sometimes disquieting ( hints at Marx , Freud and Einstein ) but finally it boils down to " we hate the Jews because we have to " . Danny is definitely a complex character , caught in a web of contradictions . One of the strongest scenes shows former victims of the Nazis during WW2 ; it's of course with them that we side , and whatever Danny says about how he despises their passivity , his protected life makes him incapable of true grit . Spoilers Danny's final sacrifice is revealing : if God's wrath had killed him as pharaoh's tribe drowned in the tide ( eg if he had accidentally been killed during one of his terrorisma acts or sentenced to death by a human court ) , the movie would have been a religious one ( God's victory on evil ) . Danny chose the other way out . They will be speaking for a long time of the final sequence : it resembles an atheist version of that of " Jacob's ladder " . The stairs and the teacher's sentence have something of Borges . End of spoilers . To say that " the believer " is unique is to state the obvious . Even more intriguing , the most celebrated names ( Theresa Russel and Billy Zane ) are only supporting actors . At a time when graveyards are often profaned , when the far right wing's bad moon is on the rise almost everywhere , this kind of film has become a necessity . Henry Bean is a very clever director and I hope to see more of his films in the future .
the best Indiana Jones movie ever ?	The third and the best of the adventures of Indiana Jones . In this new film , the famous archeologist is searching for a mythical object : " the Graal " . This is the glass in which the Christ would have drank during the last meal with his apostles . His father assists him in his investigations because he's got precious information about the Graal . So , a long trip begins and will lead our two heroes from Venice to the Middle East in passing by Berlin . You can guess it , this trip has got its rough patches ( otherwise the movie would appear devoid of interest ) . Indeed , the Nazis wish to discover the Graal too because it would make them powerful even dangerous . Steven Spielberg designed his movie like a fascinating treasure hunt and he had the good idea by bringing Sean Connery . Thanks to his presence , the movie's got a certain humor ( perhaps a little too convenient but the result works ) and allows to lighten the movie . " Indiana Jones and the last crusade " is also a good surprise because it wipes out the unhappy memory of the previous movie : " Indiana Jones and the temple of doom " . I found it too horrendous , bloody and even annoying due to Kate Capshaw . Here , to film Indiana Jones ' incredible adventures , Spielberg adopted a dramatic and especially efficient film-making . He also avoids all that could make the movie fall in the faults quoted in the second movie . Moreover , there aren't any injury times , the rhythm is skilfully sustained ( particularly during the pursuits ) and it's better this way because the result is very convincing . Obviously , the movie doesn't go without a few unlikelinesses . Spielberg also brilliantly used the good old recipes for the adventure film : weird and exotic sceneries , the struggle between good and evil , the magic object that possesses supernatural powers etc . . . The only criticism I have to make of Spielberg is that the screenplay is perhaps well boosted but it doesn't also succeed in hiding a certain manicheism : the Nazis wish to get rid of Jones and his father and to discover the Graal would help them to satisfy their strength . An adventure movie entertaining enough to sustain the interest and rather well performed . Let's add the imposing music ( as usual ) composed by John Williams .
what lies beneath a cozy upper class mansion	Michel Deville is a French filmmaker known for his aesthetic refinement and " Péril en la Demeure " bears its author's trademark . It's filmed with elegance and everything from the scenery to the acting , the camera angles to the music without mentioning witty dialogs breathes the refined . One can't forget the neat link shots , the fluid editing that add to the pernicious charm this shady thriller exudes from its three exploited mainsprings : perversion , manipulation and voyeurism . Nearly everyone in this film is a peeping tom like the offbeat female neighborhood ( Anémone ) who films the lovemaking between the guitarist teacher David ( Christophe Malavoy ) and Julia ( Nicole Garcia ) or Julia's husband Graham ( Michel Piccoli ) who watched these lovemaking sessions on the videotape . As for the manipulation , Julia leads David up the garden path by making him believe that he killed her husband while seasoned killer Daniel ( Richard Bohringer ) tries to make him understand that he's got a mission to fulfill . Deville diverts the codes , the ingredients of the genre to his own advantage to create a stylish , idiosyncratic thriller and a mirror film directed to the viewer about his peeping tom side . It's easy to let oneself immerse in this universe and to forget the irregularities or glitches that undermine a little the storytelling even if Deville has recourse to zones of shadow and clues likely to explain the characters ' motivations . If the filmmaker bore this in mind , he can be forgiven for his possible mistakes .
The seeds .	Although it's Chabrol's second effort ( the first one being " le beau serge " featuring the same actors ) , this one is closer to Chabrol-as - we - know-him . The detective ending and the first steps in the bourgeois world of Brialy character herald Chabrol ' s heyday ( which begins with " les biches " , encompasses such works as " la femme infidèle " , " que la bête meure " " le boucher " " la rupture " " juste avant la nuit " and ends with " les noces rouges " ; that's not to say all the movies were great during that period : " doctor Popaul " and " la decade prodigieuse " can be forgotten " ; that does not mean there were no great works after " wedding in blood " ( les noces ) either as testify such memorable works as " Violette NOzières " , " Une affaire de femmes " or " l'enfer " . But in France the 1967-1973 era is generally regarded as Chabrol's peak , with " le boucher " , his towering achievement . So we enter the bourgeois world with Brialy's character , a bon vivant as we say in France , with parents ( whom we never see ) who provide him money and a comfortable flat . He is a student , but we never see him studying , girls and pleasures taking the best of him . In direct contrast with him , enters Blain , his provincial cousin . He comes from a much more modest background , his parents ( whom we never see either ) had certainly to struggle hard to send him to the Latin Quarter . So from the beginning , the incommunicability is total . Blain is a grind , and if sometimes he accepts to follow his life-lover cousin in not-so-intellectual places in Paris , he knows he shall not disappoint his old parents . Brialy's kind of life is bewildering for a young lad like Blain : a scene is particularly strange , baroque , and even threatening : some fascination for Nazism from Brialy and his clique during a strange party ( it's 1959 , and German occupation is not that much far behind after all ) . Chabrol has ready begun his bourgeoisie wholesale massacre : Brialy is the prototype of the bourgeois student , selfish and smug , self-confident and apolitical ( And however , 1959 , it's Algerian war ! Young French are sent to do the dirty job ) . Apolitical , such is also Blain's case , but with more excuses : after all , when you're poor . . In his autobiography " le ruisseau des singes " , Brialy told that Chabrol ( and the producer ) had planned an happy end with the two cousins running across the fields , reconciled . Both endings were filmed , and finally the two actors urged Chabrol to renounce this silly conclusion . Hence an almost Hitchcockian ending , Hitchcock whose influence will grow over the years in Chabrol's work .
A new genesis .	This is a fantasy film that should not be missed . Rarely shown on the screens , it's almost forgotten , even by French fantasy buffs . Christian de Challonges creates an unsettling scary atmosphere without using one single special effect . The animals , omnipresent , seem to watch the human , and to understand what eludes them . Sometimes it evokes Roman Polanski's early style , but without the Pole director's favorite camera tricks . This is a movie so rich it can be interpreted in different ways . I will suggest mine : this might be a Garden of Eden parable , and the two heroes would be modern Adam and Eve . A lot of clues are in full agreement with that : " Are the insects watching us ? Karina says . I feel someone mighty watch us as if we were insects " ; the man , who seems afraid of the woman , the marriage is consummated only at the end of the movie , after the woman has released . . the snake ; the ending which is completely unexpected and becomes a metaphor of the fall after the original sin . Challonges describes a world apparently normal , but he introduces unusual elements little by little . The man's clients ( he's a vet ) are offbeat , their pets are more and more weird . Besides , Anna Karina's strange beauty enhances the mystery . An impending menace is hanging over the fragile human race . A visitor says : " it wouldn't take much to eliminate the human being on this planet " . This must be a hard-to-find movie , but if you can find it and you like the fantasy genre , this is an unqualified must . We're closer to " twelve monkeys " than " un peu de soleil dans l'eau froide " ( I would not recommend the latter ) .
love and only love . . .	With " Jeanne and the perfect guy " ( 1998 ) , we can be grateful to the duo Olivier Ducastel / Jacques Martineau for a thing : having lent credibility again to French musical . A cinematographic genre whose golden age was in the sixties but which had somewhat sunk into oblivion at the end of the twentieth century . It is the story of Jeanne ( Virginie Ledoyen ) who works as a receptionist in a travel agency . She lives a simple life and waits for the love of her life . She is persuaded that she found him with Olivier who also shows love for her . But he disappears overnight . He has his reasons : he is HIV positive . But Jeanne persists . She absolutely wants to spend her life with him . Given that Olivier is HIV positive and his days are numbered , it is probably Jeanne who is right . We can see it : the film-makers have chosen a delicate and bleak topic . However , we couldn't attribute the two quoted topics to the presented treatment . Indeed , Ducastel and Martineau's work is bursting with joy of living and loving . It contains ravishing songs which often come out of the blue but they integrate well into the plot . There's also a luminous photography with sparkling colors , a light making . In the content and form , it is a beautiful tribute to Jacques Demy's universe that the two authors offer us . Besides , Olivier's role is held by the latter's son : Matthieu Demy . The problem of AIDS is tackled without sentimentality and the film-makers avoid useless pathos . They also succeed in creating emotion in front of Matthieu's life broken by this terrible disease . As for Virginie Ledoyen , she confirms all the good we can think of her . With all that's been previously said , we can conclude by saying that " Jeanne and the perfect guy " is a light and shiny movie which enables to believe in love and in happiness . It would also reconcile anyone with life . The two authors have surely been satisfied with the result because they won't hesitate to use a second time , their magic system : pessimist topic / optimist treatment for their next movie : " Drôle de Félix " ( 2000 ) . For this film , AIDS will still be at the background but musical will have given ground to the road-movie . Of course , this movie will reach the same goal as " Jeanne " : to believe in love and happiness .
Cops and robbers , it's all the same .	I have always thought that Italian comedies were far superior to French ones . They all have a tragical side , which eludes the French directors . " Guardie e Ladri " is along chase between a two-bit crook and a cop with a tender heart . The first scene when the lad pretends he is a guide and shows to the naive tourist Colombus's grave and Poppea's bathtub is sheer genius . If it were not enough , the guide finds an " inestimable " coin , a sesterce from Augustus ' time ! The depiction of the two families , the cozy house of the cop where the girl plays the piano and the seedy small flat where the runaway packs into with his large family rings true . Actually Monicelli calls the establishment into question : unemployment , poverty , plenty of mouthes to feed , can we really blame the thief ? The last picture is revealing .
Somewhere a place for us ?	Those were the outcasts of WW2 . German war prisoners who decide to rebel against their country . Karl-aka " Happy " - agrees to become a spy in the " pay " of Americans at the end of WW2 in his country . A country in ruins . The " Third Reich " which should have lasted one thousand years was collapsing . Oskar Werner gives a restrained moving performance . If " underacting " has a meaning ( not meant pejoratively ) , that's exactly what it is . He watches his country fall as if he does not belong there anymore . He meets people he used to know , a girl ( Knef ) he could love ( but he won't ) , but he knows from the start that wherever he goes , he is an outcast . His new " Friends " use him as a pawn in their game , and " his motherland will not cradle him anymore " . Anatole Litvak , an European who used to work in France - where the first scenes take place - in the thirties ( and later would in the fifties / sixties ) knows what he is talking about . He joined the army during WW2 ; and " decision before dawn " was one of his finest achievements . Like this ? try this . . . Vent d ' Est Robert Enrico 1993
Louis Jouvet : : what a teacher !	Although Louis Jouvet remains in the periphery , the film belongs to him . More than to the director himself . He portrays a dramatic art teacher - which he was in real life - and when he gives a piece of advice to his " students " - who are , ironically , already professionals : Odette Joyeux , Bernard Blier-the film always rings true , it's quite realistic . There are many sequences where the students perform scenes from classic playwrights - my favorite is the excerpt from " taming of the shrew " - and Jouvet's comments and critics are always insightful , as if it were cinema verite . But the scene in the laundry where Jouvet convinces Isabelle's aunt and uncle that their niece was born to play on stage is pure Jeanson : it's the famous moment when Jouvet explains to them that if he wears his Legion d'Honneur , it is to impress the morons . Opinions are divided over the " true " love affairs . Cecilia ( Odette Joyeux ) is a spoiled child who tries to take revenge on her ex-lover who has left her for Isabelle . The writers tried to connect the fictitious heroes to reality but it would take Marcel Carné and Jacques Prévert to fully succeed in that task ( " Les Enfants du Paradis " ) . Just sit back and watch the great artist Jouvet at work . He makes all the scenes he's not in almost mediocre by comparison .
The crowning version .	I do not think the 1994 remake is so appalling . But it cannot hold a candle to this one , for sure , though . Part of the reason can be found , IMHO , in how the two directors deal with the main character . THe color version gambles on Albert Finney's performance and overlooks the rest of the cast which is not that much exciting in the first place ( M . Modine is rather bland ) . Here , the whole cast is outstanding , from the young guy who plays the student to Jean Kent , a bitchy wife , from Nigel Patrick's bewildered science teacher who becomes a human being during the movie to Wilfrid Hyde-White's ( whatever a precedent user's view on the matter ) mischievous , suave and finally cruel headmaster . Of course Michael Redgrave steals the show , but he gets good support all along the way . His performance is subdued , but emotionally intense , and if you do not shed a tear during his final speech , you must have a heart of stone . The black and white cinematography and the stifling atmosphere give the tragedy the three unities ( place , time and action ) and an inventive directing makes us forget it's a play , like in the best Mankiewicz works .
The first link on the chain .	" Jenny " inaugurates the famous series of movies which made Marcel Carné one of the most brilliant directors of the era . From 1936 to 1946 , with scenarist Jacques Prévert ( and once with Henri Jeanson ) he created what the critics called the " réalisme poétique " . One should note that Carné himself used to hate this label . But who cares when you deal with such works as " quai des brumes " " le jour se lève " and " les enfants du paradis " , to name but three ? Jenny ( Françoise Rosay ) is a madam , and when her daughter comes back from England , she does not want her to find out what her job is really like . The plot is rather melodramatic and a bit cheesy , but the cast , including Jean-Louis Barrault , Charles Vanel and Robert Le Vigan is first-rate . A dirty world , which is compared to the silt at the bottom of muddy waters . And as Jenny's final line says : " when you're at the bottom , you've got to stay at the bottom " .
Barnyard stories	The story , even if takes place when agriculture was beginning to modernize ( the threshing machine ) , was arguably inspired by Emile Zola's " La Terre " . Vanel's character recalls the Père Fouan even if he does not want the earth to be shared between his brothers and sister . He loves the earth and nothing else and the conclusion of the film proves him right , at least to the authors ' eyes . " La Ferme Du Pendu " ( The hanged man's farm ) is a rural melodrama , without the thriller side of contemporary works such " La Ferme Aux Loups " or the celebrated " Goupi Mains Rouges " . Its depiction of the peasants is less caricatured than in Becker's work . The long scene of the wedding is excellent , complete with songs ( Bourvil in a supporting part sings one of his " logical " songs ) , the bridesmaids ' lament which goes on repeating that marriage carries away romanticism and true love , blue jokes , and a curious dance where the guests jump over chairs . The movie transcends clichés : the farm girl who got pregnant by one of the brothers , the bad boy who finally realizes that a child could be his salvation . Even if the word is not uttered , the master of the farm wants his servant to have an abortion . If Charles Vanel is great as the patriarch ( actually the eldest brother ) , he is matched every step of the way by Alfred Adam , a lady killer who becomes disabled and who turns mad before hanging himself desperate because of the child he would never have . " La Ferme Du Pendu " is arguably one of Jean Dreville's three best movies ( the others being " Les Affaires Sont Les Affaires " and " Le Visiteur " ; let's forget his celebrated tear-jerker , " La Cage Aux Rossignols " remade as " Les Choristes ) . The death of François on his plow commends admiration and respect . As Laura Nyro would sing : " and when I die , there'll be one child born to carry on ! "
It's a long way to Gibraltar .	" La ligne de demarcation " is arguably the most successful Chabrol movie of his transitional period - roughly from " l'oeil du malin " ( 1963 ) to " la route de Corinthe ( 1967 ) . Although there are many characters , this is a well-constructed script , adapted from the Colonel Remy's book . The film is dedicated to French men and women who became smugglers and helped soldiers and Jews to cross the demarcation line which divided France into two parts : occupied and unoccupied zone during WW2 . Among many characters the couple Maurice Ronet / Jean Seberg stands out : he is a defeated officer , his war is over , and he cannot get over the 1940 debacle . On the contrary her war has only begun . she's involved in resistance and he thinks at the beginning of the movie that finally what happened was fair cause the Germans are the strongest . Seberg's beauty illuminates the movie : her face when she hears the coded message " It's a long way to Gibraltar " is one of the rare moments of happiness in a somber movie . French are not all depicted as heroes . Some are hateful cowards , who pretend they help the Jews and gives them away to the gestapo . In its way , " la ligne de démarcation " foreshadows several aspects of Chabrol future heyday . Two of his favorite actors , Stephane Audran and Jean Yanne are already here ( " le boucher " ) . The entomological depiction of the villages like in the aforementioned movie is here too . And in some scenes ( the attic , the burial , the forest where the patrol is on the prowl ) Chabrol displays his skills of master of suspense . Good cast .
evening glory	Grimley , a small mining town in the Yorkshire is at death's door . The pit which constitutes for many blue collars their sole course of action ( even their " raison d'être " ) is on the brink of closing down . A good number of them gathers to play in a brass band , the Grimley Colliery Band , led by Danny , a tubercular but steady conductor who devotes in it all his energy and this is where things go askew . If Danny advocates an intensive training and demands from his fellows more investment , his occasional musicians are more preoccupied by the impending closing down of the pit . And the arrival of a young woman , Gloria who works for the governmental agency who has to cut off the jobs antagonized many members . Then , in the space of a few days , things happen quickly : the minors choose to vote for voluntary unemployment , the pit closes down but in the meanwhile , the band wins several musical competitions which enable them to attend the finale in the prestigious Royal Albert Hall . It's a momentum concert to enable them to express their plight and their anger against Thatcherism . The director Mark Herman chose to locate his half-comic , half-tragic film in a prickly British era so as to stress the ravages of Thatcherism on the mining industry and to make the audience feel how much thousands of minors suffered by finding themselves jobless overnight . There are echoes with Ken Loach's cinema : the gloomy setting , a category of workers ( here , minors ) with a more than modest living standards and the same committed side to sympathize with their plight . However , Herman's piece of work contains a good dose of humor and it's not a free choice from the director to have incorporated it into his scenario . The very last sequences with their false air of happy-end and the rueful background would convey an impending sorrow . Herman perfectly understood that it was vital to include this component because the end of the film will abandon these castoffs to their fate . This indispensable humor usually linked with the brass musical sequences and cleverly tapped in the way it precedes according a more or less lapse of time a raw or gritty scene stops the movie from falling in a desperate blackness and paves the way to a formula Herman applied with gusto here : mix slightness with gravity . Inthis respect , his directorial style works wonders like this ingenious alternate editing in one scene when we see the orchestra play and the tension which arises in the put office and the declarations made by the manager to the journalists . But Herman's directing often rises to the occasion , notably during one of the key-moments : the finale scene . His camera , either makes itself as inconspicuous as possible to let the musicians take advantage of this moments either aerial to enhance it . Symbols are also the director's forte : the billiard ball which eventually succeeds in falling in the hole anticipates the film's finale whereas Phil's empty house after the bailiffs ' coming and the withdrawal of his wife and children reflects his despondent state of mind . Herman also shelved certain narrative conventions : the end of the film in which we don't smell any odor of " happy end " diverts the codes of the success story : these minors and occasional musicians will have won the national competition and known their hour of glory but it won't alter the murky future that awaits them . In a way the viewer identifies himself to the audience in the Royal Albert Hall : bitter , helpless and Danny's speech is of a harrowing speech . Then , in another extent , look at the love Andy ( Ewan McGregor ) feels for Gloria . Where a Hollywood director would have filmed their love affair from the beginning , Herman is more astute at this game and proceeds by small touches : we only sees close-ups of McGregor and lets the suggested filter through . The 2 young people will exchange their first kiss only in the very last sequence . It would be a crime to pass over the topnotch and true to life cast . The actors take their roles with an admirable easiness and naturalness . A special mention to Pete Dopplewaite , a chameleon actor who displays once again his exceptional gifts of actor ( remember the eerie Kobayoshi in Bryan Singer's " Usual Suspects , 1995 ) and Ewan McGregor whose career was buoyed the year the movie was open thanks to Danny Boyle with " Trainspotting " ( 1996 ) . It's just a shame that a certain Manicheism taints a little the film in the relationships between Gloria's boss and her ( he isn't treated as a caricature but the way he treats Gloria makes him an obnoxious character ) but it's minor quibble . " Brassed Off " is a wonderful piece of work straddling between laughter and emotion . When British cinema is able to incorporate laughter in a thorny social situation , it can shine and Mark Herman's flick is a good example , see it at any costs !
Three Marlene .	Marlene Dietrich , even if she does not appear is present here : she's the marvelous Gene Tierney , the terrifying Ona Munson and the cynical Victor Mature . " The Shanghai gesture " is one of my favorite Sternberg movies . I love the lines which warns us at the beginning of the film : it's not real Shanghai , it does not take place in the present . " The Shanghai gesture " is an unclassifiable work : a film noir ? a melodrama ? Most likely an extravaganza , an incredible exotic story which smells of the intoxicating perfume of poisonous flowers . The gigantic dive looks like a cobweb which the high priestess Mother Gin Sling spins . " Why not Mother Whiskey Soda ? " Tierney asks . All the characters are not what they seem , they just pretend . Tierney has two names ( one of them is the well-chosen " Poppy " ) and we only learn her real identity in the second half in a scene which seems completely " out of the movie " . Mature is Doctor Omar , doctor of nothing ! Even the women in the cages and the sailors who buy them just pretend . Nothing is real . Tierney's downfall is depicted in lavish detail : from the elegant woman of the beginning to the wreck Gin Sling invites to her Chinese New Year feast . Directing is absolutely breathtaking , when the camera circles around the dive where a cast of thousands - Sternberg even pays a tribute to the extras in the cast of credits , which is rare , to my knowledge , the first and last time it had been made-surrounds the heroine , or in the final scenes , when the shots merge with the firecrackers of the New Year . " The Shanghai gesture " may be a guilty pleasure . But this kind of pleasure , I ask for more !
one of the saviors of horror and fantasy cinema ?	Surely so ! Along with " the Blair Witch Project " ( 1999 ) , " the Sixth Sense " ( 1999 ) or " the Others " ( 2001 ) , this Japanese gem is a bonanza for the genre aforementioned insofar as it favors in real screenplays , pure psychological terror which is the leading thread to a crescendo . This crop of masterpieces constitutes a valid antidote to the flood of horror movies coming from the Hollywood firm in which a ton of special effects supersede cinematographic invention . But Hideo Nakata shows us that it is still possible to shiver with a minimum of means and a maximum of shrewdness . I watched Gore Verbinski's remake shot in 2002 prior to Nakata's original film and so I can compare the two works . I do think that it's every bit as good as the 1998 film from an artistic perspective . Both are terrific even if Verbinski tends to show more of the plot and its ambiguous sides and his reflection on the deadly power of TV and the media is more pronounced than in its Japanese ambassador . My general impression about Nakata's work is that his style is more thrifty and straightforward than Verbinski's with sparse moments and a nearly contemplative pace . Evolving in a Japan caught between a modernism epitomized by the TV and an archaism which wants to protect one-time manners and customs , the filmmaker made the good choice of favoring the suggested and the off-camera to mold an unnerving atmosphere . This makes the viewer's imagination work and also makes him feel ill-at-ease when he realizes that the frontier between the rational and the irrational becomes increasingly thin . Because if one has an inking about who shot these outlandish images , one doesn't know how they were filmed . Unsettling isn't it ? However , Nakata borrowed a little from American cinema : the first sequence with the two young girls all alone in a house in which strange phenomena occur echoes " Scream " . The character of the audacious estranged journalist who investigates a serious case has been seen many times before or since . But fortunately , Nakata skipped the possibility of a new union with her ex-husband . Anyway , " Ringu " bears the mark of a genuine work which revived Asiatic fantastic film . It caused so much stir that the evil Sadako became a cult character . Her figurine even dethroned the mask of Frankenstein and the killer in " Scream " in terms of popularity . " Ringu " also gave birth to a sequel and even a prequel , probably to shed more light on the mysterious character of Sadako and to work more the seam . Meanwhile , Hollywood stared at this cultural phenomenon with a keen interest .
The journey	" Phone call from a stranger " is an unique movie . However much I search my memory , I cannot find a movie like this one , with the exception of Peter Weir's remarkable ( and overlooked , people liking weepies such as " dead poets society " best ) " Fearless " ( 1993 ) where James Bridge , being a survivor from a plane crash , calls his life into question . Exactly what Gary Merill does in " Phone call " : there's no doubt about it , Negulesco's work was ahead of its time . Using " subjective " flashbacks ( the over possessive mother remembering her daughter-in-law in an almost eerie scene ) , a disturbing atmosphere in the first part - in spite of a good share of humor - on the plane or in the airport , a complex screenplay including an unexpected last scene - The photograph of Bette Davis wearing a swimsuit is a stroke of genius - , Negulesco made a sleeper which young generations will discover ( no remake needed , please ) . When we meet the hero , he is not that nice . By changing the others ' life ( the last picture of Beatrice Straight and Ted Donaldson is deeply moving , and at the same time avoids pathos which mars melodrama so badly with any lesser talent ) he will learn sympathy for the others , compassion and above all forgiving . That will be his last call for tonight : words of pardon ; when you see broken families , all you've got to do is thank God to have yours . As Christ said : He who never sinned . . . . . .
Liberty is a concept by which we measure our laws . .	Although Bunuel was to make one more film , " cet obscur objet du désir " , " phantom of liberty " would remain his testament , his last sigh , to mention the title of his memoirs . The key to the movie is the segment dealing with the naughty gendarmes , the sociology teacher and Margaret Mead's books . Law must not be taken for granted , it depends on where and when you live . Something which would seem unbearable to us is nothing but natural to other human beings . The whole movie walks this fine line , being built around this very concept . It is Bunuel's most accessible movie and it's completely mad , which is fine with me . Its construction is not unlike Max Ophuls's " la ronde " ( 1950 ) as a new character provides the connection between the segments . It's not really free-form , in the sense of the nouvelle vague , nothing Godardesque here and anyway , Bunuel possessed something Jean-Luc will never have : humor . And the screenplay displays care and respect for the audience . One should point out Jean-Claude Carrière's importance in Bunuel's last works in France . In " discreet charm of the bourgeoisie " , humor which was latent in the former works ( the dogs in " Viridiana " ; the pineapple in " Nazarin " ) came to the fore . " Phantom " is probably not as strong as the previous work : it's sometimes uneven and some segments ( the old aunt and her nephew ) drag on . But most of the times , it's a delight . Bunuel's usual targets , the Church and the Army are both given a rough ride . But social conventions , " normality " are too . A bevy of great actors take us to a magical mystery tour ( Bunuel's regret was that too many movies lack mystery ) Here he focused on the secret of the passage of the night hours , wherever the action takes place , in Brialy's and Vitti's bedroom or the inn where the guests are weird to say the least ( the scenes in the inn recall those of " la voie lactée , 1969 ) . And the ostrich in the couple's room , we find it back at the zoo , for the finale , when repression rises . When we bury our head in the sand , French people call it " ostrish politics " ! Bunuel was a great man . Everything he did is crying to be watched . When the movie was released , probably upset by the huge commercial success , some critics called it " Bunuel ' s holiday homework " . Time proved them wrong . In 2005 , " phantom " is solid as a rock .
Exile on Scarlet Street	Jean Renoir's " la Chienne " is a crucial film in the history French cinema : it's arguably the first talkie which is a true masterpiece . Fritz Lang certainly liked Renoir , for he remade two of his best works . In the fifties he would redo " la Bete Humaine " as " Human desire " ( and using the two actors of his precedent film as he did for " Scarlet Street " : Glenn Ford and Gloria Grahame ) . But " Human desire " , for a French who knows the original by heart , was a disappointment . On the other hand " Scarlet Street " is quite successful if you do not compare it with Renoir's " La Chienne " . Although Dudley Nichols roughly follows the 1931 plot , the two movies are worlds apart . The first thing to bear in mind is that Jean Renoir , in the early thirties , was nothing short of an anarchist : both " la Chienne " and its follow-up " Boudu Sauvé des Eaux " were ferocious attacks against the Society , the Bourgeoisie , the Army and the Church . Michel Simon's portrayal has almost nothing to do with that of EG Robinson : uglier than the American thespian , Simon created a thoroughly new character ( in the French cinema ) who would reappear in the next work . He , too , became a tramp at the end of the film , but this tramp would become " Boudu " who took a spectacular revenge on the bourgeoisie . If you are curious enough to see " La Chienne " after watching " Scarlet Street " , you ' ve got to see " Boudu " too , if you want to understand Renoir . Fritz Lang's concerns are not the same : he was obsessed by the fact that any human being is a potential criminal . EG Robinson plays a character who recalls the one he plays in the " woman in the window " ( it's revealing that " Scarlet Street " ends with the portrait of Joan Benett ) . A professor in " woman . . . " , Robinson is a painter amateur in " scarlet street " : a way to keep reality away , and reality is his missus , a shrew also present in Renoir's opus . The wife's former husband plays a much more prominent part in the first version : he was a warrant officer in the army during WW1 . Lang's hero , unlike Renoir's , feels remorse . Never Renoir would have indulged himself the scene on the train , where a man warns the unfortunate painter : there's something higher than human justice ! And he does not even hint at God . We are in Lang ' s world when Chris becomes crazy in the flat , with an unusual inventive use of the soundtrack and the lightnings . But you have got to notice that both versions feature the immoral death of Johnny / Dédé . In 1953 , the ending of Zola's " la Bete Humaine " was terribly sweetened for " Human Desire " .
Slaughterhouse museum	Franju had been making shorts for more than ten years before he broached the feature film in 1959 with his debut " La Tête Contre Les Murs " . With the exception of " Les yeux Sans Visage " his shorts are more famous around the world , particularly " Le Sang Des Bêtes " ( 1948 ) Two years later , " Hotel des Invalides ' is in a way more of the same : it's no longer the blood of the beasts , it's the human blood , this blood which was shed in interminable wars . Franju's is not one of these documentaries you watch respectfully : it's a committed work . IT looks like an academic short ; it begins with the historic facts : Louis the Fourteenth , the Sun King wanted a place for his old campaigners to rest and to end their life . Today , the Invalides are the army museum , but Franju and the voice over ( provided by none other than Michel Simon ! ) make it some kind of chamber of horrors . His camera makes the dome of the monument , in the distance , as disturbing as the slaughterhouse he depicted two years before . When a pair of lovers are playing with a canon , the voice remarks : " don't they know it means death and destruction ? " or something like that . The way Franju films the armors ( even one child's armor ) gives the jitters . In the rooms of the museum devoted to WW1 , Franju interrupts the visit and scenes of WW1 in the trenches are edited in ; it ends with the casualties of war figures : one man out of 27 people in France . The end of the visit may look like , to some , nice , as a group of children sings the old folk song " Auprès De Ma Blonde " . These children are " Enfants De Troupe " ( Children reared by the army ) - see for that matter Yves Boisset's movie " Allons Z'Enfants " - : fortunately , it does not exist anymore , for these children were cannon fodder . And whey they sing the line " Et Ma Jolie Colombe Qui Chante Jour et Nuit " ( = and my sweet dove who's singing day and night ) we can ask to ourselves " how many seas must a white dove sail / before she sleeps in the sand ? " ( Bob Dylan ) " Aupres De Ma Blonde " was written in the seventeenth century , during the wars in Holland under the Sun King's reign . We've come full circle .
The message .	It's almost impossible to see " poussière d'empire " in France nowadays . It was broadcast on FR3 ( the third channel ) about two years after its release and since it vanished into thin air . Like this dust of the title . The two French stars ( Dominique Sanda , De Niro's co-star in " 1900 " , and Jean - François Stevenin , one of Truffaut's favorite actors , notably in " l'argent de poche " ) disappear in the first third of the movie , à la Janet Leigh in " psycho " . But here we do not deal with a thriller . And although Sanda and Stevenin play a nun and a sergent coming to Indochine villages to catechize the " natives " , it is not a war movie . It is not an adventures movie either . It's really difficult to pinpoint where the film belongs . Hence its intriguing charm . The main theme is a message from a maquis to his wife . Unbeknownst to them , the two French people carried this message . Then it becomes the star of the movie , becoming a fan , then a wedge for an old radio . Lam Lêh wanted to link his culture with the French one and he pulled it off masterfully . If the French cinema forgets its most innovative works , it's the thin end of the wedge . " Poussière d'empire " deserves a DVD release .
Quite mad , which is fine with me !	" Fanfan la tulipe " is still Gerard Philippe's most popular part and it began the swashbuckler craze which throve in the French cinema in the 1955-1965 years . It made Gina Lollobrigida a star ( Lollobrigida and Philippe would team up again in René Clair " s " Belles de nuit " the same year . " Fanfan la tulipe " is completely mad , sometimes verging on absurd . Henri Jeanson's witty lines - full of dark irony - were probably influenced by Voltaire and " Candide " . Antimilitarism often comes to the fore : " these draftees radiate joie de vivre - and joie de mourir when necessary ( joy of life and joy of death ) " " It becomes necessary to recruit men when the casualties outnumber the survivors " " You won the battle without the thousands of deaths you had promised me , the king Louis XV complains , but no matter , let's wait for the next time . " A voice over comments the story at the beginning and at the end and history is given a rough ride : height of irony , it's a genuine historian who speaks ! Christian-Jaque directs the movie with gusto and he knows only one tempo : accelerated . Remake in 2003 with Vincent Perez and Penelope Cruz . I have not seen it but I do not think it had to be made in the first place .
L'Oeil Etait Dans La Tombe . . . . .	. . . Et regardait Cain ( Victor Hugo , La Légende des Siècles ) ( trad : The eye was in the grave watching Cain . . . ) The follow-up to " la Rupture " , with the same actors ( Bouquet and Audran ) , " Juste Avant la Nuit " is its exact contrary . In the light of the chilly - and with hindsight , totally unfair-reviews " la Rupture " had received , Chabrol came back to the simple bald style of " la Femme Infidèle " . " La Rupture " had a lot of subplots , characters and action whereas " Juste Avant la Nuit " is not even a thriller : it's pure psychological drama ; and there are only three characters : the husband ( who sleeps with his best friend's wife ) , the wife and the friend . Charles ( Bouquet ) accidentally killed his lover as they were playing S / M games . No one suspects him , not even the victim's friend who saw him once there in the room where they used to meet . Life could go on . Like Michel Duchaussoy in " Que la Bete Meure " ( 1969 ) , he could get away with it . He isn't even a suspect . The Police investigate , but they do not ask him any questions . The main originality of " Juste Avant la Nuit " is that Charles is his own worst enemy . He is literally eaten with remorse , he wants to be punished ! After all , in his advertising agency , his accountant who has embezzled is arrested and will be tried . So why not him ? Little by little , he confesses the whole thing to his wife who thinks that " it's only an accident " . Audran's character possesses ambiguity : in several respects , she ' s still some kind of child ; we see her make chocolate cake and play with her children ; we never see her have sex with her husband and they do not share the same bed ( an element which was already present in " la Femme Infidèle " ) The scene where Bouquet describes his crime and his - obscure - motives is frighteningly intense , Chabrol makes us attend the scene in lavish details without using any flashbacks ( the prologue was also very restrained ) . The looks and smiles which were a true sign language in " la Femme Infidele " have been replaced by low voices , almost whispering . ( Half of the lines are whispered ) When he tells the victim's husband the whole truth , the man seems impassible , a Buddah's face . " I could have done the same , should Helene have been Laura " " I do not like revenge " . " You want to be punished cause you want to suffer " his wife screams out of despair . " You used to see that girl for the same reasons " . Bouquet gives a tormented complex portrayal of a bourgeois - Bouquet says he is afraid of becoming a bourgeois , that's perhaps why Chabrol takes pity on him in the last sequences - who thinks that any crime must be punished : he is in direct contrast to his character in " la Rupture " . " Juste Avant la Nuit " belongs to that short period ( 4 or 5 years ) during which Chabrol was arguably the best director in France and was making the most brilliant films of his career . All those works end in quietness and peace : on the sea ( " Que la bête meure " , where Michel Duchaussoy sails away ) , in a luminous green landscape in " la Femme Infidèle " , near a lake ( " le Boucher " ) , with a balloon release ( " la Rupture " ) or here in front of the sea where children are playing . " They're beginning to forget " Grannie says . . . .
The heart is a lonely hunter . ( Carson McCullers )	Merlusse is a teacher whose pupils create mayhem in his class . " Merlusse " is a nickname ( coming from the word " merluche " = dried cod ) . He seems harsh and strict , but under an off-putting manner , he hides real affection for his students . It's Christmas's night : some of the boarders have gone , but some have got to stay behind the sad walls of a gloomy school . Some will not get a Christmas present . This Christmas , however , will not be like the other ones . A relatively short movie ( For Pagnol whose works ' running time generally exceeds two hours ) but perhaps his most endearing and moving work .
Poetic , elegiac , wonderful .	The movie is in the past conditional , because we know the real end of the story and Delmer Daves who had been studying the Indians ways for a long time did not try to fool the audience : " broken arrow " is not a nice " peace and love " movie : there are plenty of death , violence and hatred here , more than in the average western . As Cochise says , living in peace is more difficult than waging war . But Jeffords and him become legendary figures whom we can still meet today everywhere in the world , peace on earth and good will to men . Thus his story becomes universal . There's a wistful , not to say very sad side : Delmer Daves is like John Lennon singing " imagine " or Neil Young singing " Pocahontas " ( I wish I was a trapper / I would give a thousand pelts / To sleep with Pocahontas / And find out how she felt / In the morning in the fields of green / in the home land we've never seen ) : he does know that all these promises are illusive , the two protagonists trust each other , but who else can they trust ? The dice are loaded from the start . That's why the love scenes are so important and among the most visually astounding we can see in a western . Thanks partly to Debra Paget's breathtaking beauty , the scenes between Jeffords and Sonseearhay climax the movie . They give the audience a taste of a lost paradise " the homeland we've never seen " : Jefford's dream only really comes true in these sequences where the lovers are under the " big sky " in communion with nature . Some will complain because everybody speaks English , but Tom's voice-over warns us from the very start . Kevin Costner , who makes his Oscar-winning " dance with wolves " in the early nineties , owes a good deal to Delmer Daves .
he said that Christine Pascal would make a beautiful film	SPOILERS A divorced man ( Richard Berry ) learns that her daughter's got an incurable illness . They're leaving on the French and Italian roads and they tend to become closer themselves as if they wanted to escape from the terrible truth . Finally they arrive on their second home in the southern France where Berry's wife ( Anémone ) is there and she knew the truth about Violette before coming here . . . . The movie is very similar to " l'arbre de Noel " , a film made by Terence Hill in 1969 but this one was very poor and flat whereas Vincent's film is beautiful and successful ( it won the Louis Delluc's price in 1993 and it deserved it ) . In spite of the dramatical situation and the presence of death in the background , her film remains very gleeful : during their travel , the two main characters are alive , thrilled and the landscapes are magnificent and sunny , besides several pictures are beautiful . Pascal succeeds in alternating the comical and the dramatical scenes , these last ones are harrowing and touching like the sequence in the theater of Milan . Moreover , she avoids tears and it was what " l'arbre de Noel " wanted to produce . There is only one weird scene : the last sequence . Of course , it's an open end : what will Richard Berry do after he saw Violette falling asleep ? I think that it was useful because if the director had filmed Violette's death , the film would have been a flop . To sum up : a light and beautiful film .
Good short	The director is none other than my cousin . And he also acts in this excellent short . It's based on an old French song " le p'tit Bal Perdu " which was a hit in the fifties . The scenery depicts a big field where we can see a quite big table and several chairs . Men and women sit down and stand up to the rhythm of music . This exciting short was broadcast several times on the French telly . Philippe Decouflé , my cousin , won the prize of French critics in a famous festival . He was first a dancer and went to " l'Ecole du Cirque ( = circus school ) ; after this successful short , he left his native France for the broader horizons of the United States . By CLO
a new tandem fifteen years later . . .	" I would like to be filmed by you " . These tender words pronounced by Johnny Hallyday were the catalyst for Patrice Leconte to work with him and led to the creation of " l'Homme Du Train " . Very simply , it's Leconte's best film since his wondrous " la Fille Sur Le Pont " ( 1999 ) . One can say that this wish from the most popular French singer ever arrived at the right time . It means at a time when Leconte's career was cluttered with setbacks . The fashion " la Fille Sur Le Pont " heralded with a love story at the core of all the movies which followed it began to show signs of breathlessness as the stale , old-fashioned " Rue Des Plaisrs " ( 2002 ) testified . So what could Leconte do to boost his career again ? Why not producing a men story ? Thus , " l'Homme Du Train " constitutes a clear return to a genre Leconte has a liking for : the duo of men . This genre gave Leconte his very best film : " Tandem " ( 1987 ) in which Jean Rochefort and Gérard Jugnot were a remarkable mismatched pair . Fifteen years later a new mismatched pair strikes again . There's still Jean Rochefort who acts a retired French literature teacher . He teams up this time with Johnny Hallyday , a weary gangster who prepares a last break-in . Apparently , nothing lets predict a friendship between them but against all odds , the two men will become inseparable . Why ? In " Nocturne Indien " ( 1989 ) , Alain Corneau's best effort to date a character says that " we all have two lives . The true one , the one we dreamed of as a child and that we keep on living in a subterranean way and the false one , the one we live every day and leads us to the coffin " . This cue , at least its second half could serve as the thrust developed by Leconte in this film . The staple is the unlikely meeting and friendship between two men that everything opposes but will strike up a solid friendship . This friendship is strengthened by the fact that Manesquier and Milan are both sick of their respective lives which seem constricting for both of them . Each one envies each other's life and they have good reasons for this : old age and especially death are very close to them . So Manesquier is tired of his cozy life in his lascivious house and dreams of an adventurous , hazardous one . His friendship with Milan prompts him to assess his life , perhaps not a failed existence but an unfulfilled one which could have been so much better . And see how Manesquier is so lonely in his spacious house ! Behind his self-assured appearance and his sparkling look he conceals a deep vulnerability . The " Lecontian " hero par excellence . Now what about his sidekick Milan ? He carries on his shoulders a distressing past and is well aware that he's getting old and gradually losing his means of defense , just check the sequence in the café . He would have liked to spend a good part of his life in a draft proof universe in slippers but as he says : " I have never worn slippers " . Still about him , in the beginning of the film , there's a little telling detail that tells a lot about Milan's weariness of his dangerous life : to go to the chemist's , he goes through a round-about and there's a white pointer painted on the ground . Milan goes the opposite way of this pointer . . . Leconte prefers to show us signs emanating from the two pals ' will to change or exchange their lives : Milan learns Manesquier to shoot with a gun and the latter by wearing his leather jacket's sidekick puts himself in the shoes of a baddie . Then a symbolic action : Manesquier goes to the hairdresser and asks his hairdresser to have a new haircut ( a delightful allusion to another Leconte masterpiece " Le Mari De La Coiffeuse " , 1990 ) . As for Milan , Manesquier gives him slippers and one day as he's absent acts the French literary teacher . . . with obvious limits but manages quite well of his task . So , it is a well-rounded assessment of two cohesive men portraits which admirably mesh . As for the rest , Leconte's magic touch , the one that keeps his fans happy is palpable everywhere . First , it was a shrewd idea to have shot his film in the fall . This decaying climate serves the film and his topic . Furthermore , by locating the action in this small town in Southern France where " everyone knows everyone " , Leconte unearths unsuspected gifts of entomologist . And there's still this bias for the devastating absurd detail in the bargain like the baker who keeps on asking to her customers : " and with this ? " or this gangster who delivers only one line every day at ten o'clock in the morning . And let's not forget witty lines galore : " Thanks for everything " . " You know , I only gave you a drink of water " . Rochefort and Hallyday's roles were written according to their capacities of actors . So , they were written with care and respect . Rochefort proves once again here that he works wonders with Leconte . Hallyday was physically ideally cast as Milan but I would have liked that he was able to shade his acting a little more . But he's first and before all a singer . . . And while I'm on the possible reservations about Leconte's work , I'll just regret some elusive lines like the toothbrush and an end which takes the easy way . But it's minor quibble . Well done Mr . Leconte ! You were able to forge ahead in the duo of men with this treasure . Leconte's aficionados in France and abroad , here's another gem for you ! And this is one that makes my top ten best movies of 2002 .
Atmosphere , atmosphere . . .	" Hotel du Nord " is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques Prévert , but by Henri Jeanson . Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet / Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers , Annabella / Aumont . The latter is rather bland , and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf's song " les amants d'un jour " , except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one . What's fascinating today is this popular little world , the canal Saint-Martin settings . This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason . The pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air ( atmosphère ) Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphère , the whore Raymonde ( wonderful Arletty ) thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line , that is , undeniably , the most famous of the whole French cinéma : In French : " Atmosphère ? Atmosphère ? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère ? " Translation attempt : " Atmosphere ? atmosphere ? Have I got an atmosphere face ? This is our French " Nobody's perfect " .
the old laughing lady	Etienne Chatiliez can keep a cool head ! After the commercial and critical success of " Life is a long quiet river " ( 1988 ) , there must have been an immense pressure on him to make a second movie . Two years later , he resurfaced with a new feature-length film , " Tatie Danielle " . At first sight , this film seems to be less original than its predecessor . It is nevertheless a fact that it is a funnier movie to watch and it shows once again Chatiliez's brilliant talent . Etienne Chatiliez's strength comes from his skill at making laugh of a serious topic , always with a caustic and devastating humor . Furthermore , he always finds place to insert in it a little touch of social satire . These film-maker's particular gifts were already present in " life is a long quiet river " . We find them again with pleasure in " Tatie Danielle " where the director is surpassing himself and is going further in daring . Roughly , he is having a tremendous time with the adventures of this old malicious lady who is going to make life impossible for her nephews . The movie is bursting with comical sequences and no-one makes sparks fly of powerful dialogs as well as Chatiliez does . Through the Billard family's trouble then Sandrine with " Tatie Danielle " , a progressive tension grows which reaches its climax in the sequence when Tatie Danielle , hopeless after Sandrine's departure ransacks her nephews ' flat and accuses them ! Like in " Life is a long quiet river " , the contrast constitutes one of the author's main weapons . On one hand , Tatie Danielle , an old lady full of nastiness and on another hand , her nephews with an excessive kindness . It is useful to point out that the director makes a somewhat mocking description of his characters . For example , Tatie Danielle may be unbearable , she is also a very lonely old woman . She can only confide in her late husband . The latter is depicted in a photography and he is squinting ! Through this characteristic , Chatiliez cocks a snook at her main character . On another hand , in the Billard family , the father and the children have got pretty much the same first name : Jean . A discreet way to laugh at this average French familyBut Etienne Chatiliez has more than one string to his bow . Indeed , he also understood that sometimes it is better to use the power of suggestion to make particular moments successful . Thus , we learn that Tatie Danielle stirs up ill-feeling in the old people's home through the nurses and the head doctor's words . And especially , especially , Chatiliez has got a sharp sense of observation . His movie abounds of little black ideas or details that irresistibly kick the bull's eye . " Tatie Danielle " also proves one thing . Sometimes it is no-use hiring famous actors to secure the success of a movie . At the time of its release in 1990 , nearly all the actors were virtually unknown . But Tsilla Chelton gives a flawless performance and it is a delight to see Isabelle Nanty subduing the tough octogenarian . If we make an exception of some little weaknesses ( Florence Quentin , the scriptwriter has forgotten to delete a few clichés linked to old people and there are some predictable sudden new developments ) , you come out elated of the projection of Etienne Chatiliez's intelligent and malicious second movie . He passes us on the pleasure he took in shooting this story . A really funny movie and there's no reason to deny oneself of it .
Between the two mountains	Except for Dita Parlo ( " La Grande Illusion " " Au Bonheur des Dames " " L'Atalante " ) all the cast has sunk into oblivion . The film itself was restored in 1995 to excellent results . The pictures are splendid , depicting mountains landscapes and cloudy skies and colorful villages with an exceptional talent . This is one of the most underrated films of the thirties ; few people know it . I remember watching it about a decade ago and at the time I did not realize how much this was new , unusual , in a word , ground-breaking . Two villages , on the two sides of the mountain . Because they have killed his dog , but because he desires the pretty Elsi , Firmin abducts her , a girl from the " other " village . The film is extremely erotic , from Firmin crawling on the ground to catch the girl to Elsi taking the crucifix down and replacing it by a mirror which will reflect her topless body . Never Parlo was so sensual and so attractive than here . She is not the damsel in distress the audience expects . Her kid brother died when he was desperately searching her and though Firmin is not really responsible for this death , she wants to take revenge on him . The scene when she reads the letter and she learns the tragic event with the one-legged hawker shouting " presents for your fiancée ! ribbons ! scissors ! needles ! threads ! " is unforgettable . Sexual symbols abound ; sometimes we think of Luis Bunuel : this director would have loved the scene of the crucifix . Presence of the water flowing where Jeanne , the former fiancée of Firmin is praying while her village is on fire where her ex-fiancé and Elsi are both caught in their own trap ( the room where the boy locked up the girl ; the village idiot Elsi wanted to manipulate ) ; the bees pollinating the flowers ; the idiot trying to caress Elsi's legs . One should note that the whole village attends the service on Sunday but Elsi seems to be a pagan and to contaminate her abductor . The village idiot has got something of Luis Bunuel : crazy about Elsi , he would do anything to sleep with her . But as a half-wit he is an outcast in his own village and he is not part of the people who love or are loved . He ' s got to content himself with watching the puppets the hawker brings to the inhabitants . " Rapt " is a Russian-French production ; in spite of the peaceful nature , it's a story of love and hate , full of sound and fury . The soundtrack is exceptional , and the film itself can be looked upon as the missing link between the silent era ( Jeanne running on the road recalls the pre-talkie era ; so do the wonderful depictions of the meadows , of the people themselves ) and the talkies . On the other hand , the sound is astonishing , like , for instance , during the storm where the winds raging outside the house are given an unconventional unrealistic treatment . Like this ? try these . . . . . " The collector " William Wyler 1965 " La Drôlesse " Jacques Doillon 1979
Learning by doing .	Dedicated to Mrs Montessori ( Italy ) , Mr . Claparède ( Switzerland ) , Mr Bekulé ( Tchecoslovakia ) , Mr Décroly ( Belgium ) and to Mr Freinet ( France ) . The latter's wife contributed to the screenplay , and Monsieur Pascal is none other than Célestin Freinet . Celestin Freinet who was wounded in WW1 , and thus could not talk very much so had to find new methods which revolutionized teaching skills . Unlike Monsieur Pascal , he did have to resign and to create his own schools . Even today , even if you are not in a Freinet school , you can feel his influence here there and everywhere : if it had not been for him , education would perhaps have remained purely theoretical . Now for the film . First of all , this is a GOOD movie , nay , a splendid one , regarded in context . Jean-Paul Le Chanois , too often dismissed by those fusty Cahiers Du Cinema ( which should be relegated to the archives , we are in 2007 dash it ! ) , outdoes himself and gives his best film ever . Bernard Blier is wonderful as Monsieur Pascal . We all would like to be his pupils . With him , gone is the iron discipline , gone is the lesson you learned by heart even if you did not understand a single word of it , gone is the dunce the teacher shamefully hides in the back of his classroom . Monsieur Pascal loves all his pupils , he wants to give them all a chance : the classroom's dunce , reciting the 1789 Declaration des Droits de L'Homme et du Citoyen - which is much more important to Mr Pascal , and now to the youngster himself than the futuretense , an arithmetic operation or the Sun King's death - in front of the board of examiners during his " Certificat d ' Etude " ( certificate formerly obtained by pupils at the end of primary school ; it no longer exists ) climaxes the movie . WW1 was just over - and in 1948 , when the film was made , WW2 was just over too - so the time had come to face the changes . . Pascal displays the same enthusiasm , the same faith in man and the same joie de vivre as the youth of Jacques Becker's " Rendez-vous de Juillet " . He believes in social advancement : the antique dealer's attitude is revealing , by preventing the old lady from selling for a song her valuable piece of furniture , they begin to rebel against the establishment for the first time : for that man , being part of the city council has got the power in his hands . " Let there be light " is Mr Pascal's motto . When he sees an old typewriter he thinks " printing " and as Gutenberg did at the end of the Middle Ages , he is ready to take his pupils out of obscurantism . Another remarkable fact : the women , who did not vote , who were not part of the city council are often smarter than their hubbies . A blind woman " feels " the good vibrations , she feels that now children are happier , more responsible . Only naive viewers are still thinking that Truffaut was the first to turn his attention to the brats ' misfortunes in Rousseau's land . Le Chanois was one on the first to start a mini-woman ' s lib : this is already present here , this will be more obvious in " Le Cas Du Docteur Laurent " ( 1957 ) , a plea for painless childbirth . Joseph Kosma's music is magnificent : during the cast and credits , it is so stirring , so infectious that we are sure the film will not disappoint us . Something like the music George Van Parys would write for " Si Tous Les Gars du Monde " ( 1956 ) . This tuneful piece will be used again music box style when the children draw the poor cat's story and sung by the whole classroom to support their dear teacher threatened by the antique dealer and his bourgeois friends . There are so many things to write about " l'Ecole Buissonnière " : teachers of the world , you have got to see it . . . . and to show it to your pupils to make them comprehend how lucky they are to work with their computers , in their modern classrooms : there was a time when teachers had to invent everything : a water-powered electric generator which the children , learning by doing , built , and let there be light !
What I did , I can swear . . .	. . . no beast could have done it ! ( Antoine de Saint-Exupéry , Guillaumet's words , in " les Camarades " ) This famous sentence was on my mind all along the movie , which I had never heard of before and which was a big surprise for me . Once again , thanks to my good IMDb pal , Oystein , who provided me with one fine work from his native country . I will try and introduce it to my French cinebuffs friends cause it is virtually unfairly unknown over here . A resistant fighter , during WW2 , stays in an hospital . He seems seriously wounded . He remembers : the film will consist of a very long flashback . After all his companions have been killed or captured , the hero begins a long odyssey to get to the Sweden border . Little by little , we realize that the enemy is no longer the Nazis who occupy his homeland : it's the white spaces , the frozen fjords , the cold , the wolves , a hostile nature . The film is so intense that we often " feel " the hero's sufferings . Remarkable sequences : the hallucinations , the hero sees a woman , then a neon reading " GRAND HOTEL " while he is lost in a white hell ; all these humble people who risk their life for their compatriot , particularly the woman and her baby and the good old grandpa ; the " resurrection " when Jan rose from the snow , like a Nordic Lazarus ; the final rein deers stampede . This is really a splendid effort from Norway .
witty , funny , no vulgarity : all that a good comedy can ( and must ) be	The movie " Cuisines et Dépendances " ( 1993 ) had revealed Jean Pierre Bacri / Agnès Jaoui's original talent . Here , " un air de famille " ( 1996 ) which is once again an adaptation of a play written by the duo constitutes a kind of extension and especially a clear improvement for them . This movie made by Cédric Klapisch is very superior to the first quoted movie although " Cuisines et dépendances " is a worthy work . The meeting Bacri-Jaoui-Klapisch shines to delivers a stunning flick . It is difficult to tell because it is so rich and crowded with incident that it would take several pages to sum it up . So , to tell you the main reasons that justify the vision of this film , I will go to the essential . 3 things confer to the movie a strong appeal . First , the scriptwriters have the remarkable gift to make sparks fly from the single cue and to let what is left unsaid and the suggested leak out . Dialogs are also their best weapon to revamp the middle-class ' image but also to harm the characters ' meanness and faults . This last feature enables to Bacri and Jaoui to distinguish themselves in the French comedy . It is their recognizable stamp to disclose certain faults that we have inside us but which we really don't want to admit . In this way , it is quite easy to identify with the characters . We have a little " air de famille " with them . But " un air de famille " is also worth for Klapisch's accurate making with an outstanding work on the lighting effects . The lighted café contrasts with the dark restaurant in the background of the scenery . Moreover , the split of the family amazingly answers to the dreary aspect of the scenery . Little by little , the film becomes a stifling In Camera tempered by a few sequences which relate childhood memories . In another extent , there's another strong point from Klapisch : the directing of actors which is flawless and well studied . Personally I think it is a real treat to see Jean Pierre Bacri coming and going in his café , with his sullen look . Beside him , Catherine Frot is irresistible in her role of silly woman while Jean Pierre Darroussin is the sole stable character in the middle of this family which is slowly breaking up . He also tries to bring his support and comfort to the members . " Un air de famille " is a smart and ferociously funny movie . Jean Pierre Bacri and Agnès Jaoui rank among the finest comical authors of the nineties and Cédric Klapisch can without problem join the group of the best French film-makers of his generation . Don't miss this movie which will give you another image of the French comedy .
eye for an eye , tooth for a tooth	With hindsight , André Cayatte's golden hour was the 1948-1957 years , this decade which begins with " les Amants de Verone " ( which does not belong to his " legal " era , although in a way it does : aren't the final scenes some kind of trial ) and ends with this film , one of his strongest and one of his harshest . Even the conclusions of " Justice Est Faite " " Avant Le Deluge " or " Nous Sommes Tous Des Assassins " were not that pessimistic ; one has to watch the film made up of sketches " Retour A La Vie " ( segment " Le Retour de Tante Anna " ) ( 1949 ) to find such a blackness . A doctor who has been working all day is having a rest in his home in Lebanon when a man knocks on his door : his pregnant wife is not very well and he asks for help . The exhausted physician has his servant tell the lad to drive to the hospital . On the road , breakdown . When the doctor finally returns to the clinic , his desperate assistant tells him the woman died in the night : ectopic pregnancy . . " If you had been here . . . " . Is the doctor really responsible for this death ? The first part of the film is relatively slow , building little by little an inexorable tension : strange warnings , phone calls , shadows on the wall , flat tires . . . The widower is a little fat man ( Folco Lulli ) who seems harmless . The doctor ( Curd Jurgens ) feels ( and does not ) feel guilt . From the beginning , an insistent threatening atmosphere . By the beginning of the second part ( the " odyssey " in the desert ) , the film is on fire and there is no letup as it continues to build in intensity and drama as the tempers rise and violence and hatred become even greater . The little fat man which seemed ridiculous does not think that revenge is a dish best eaten cold : he wants his revenge and he takes off the " assassin " towards the infinite desert where thirst and despair awaits : " Can you explain to me why thirst is man's worst enemy ? " The feud in the desert is not unlike Von Stroheim's grandiose " greed " . And the final panoramic shot will leave you on the edge of your seat . André Cayatte Truff ' was always putting down was admired by Ingmar Bergman . Can you forget one more time the Nouvelle Vague and enjoy this extraordinary film noir , which deals with blind ( animal ? ) justice without entering a court ?
You can forgive . . .	. . . but you must not forget . Chomsky's " Holocaust " stands as the best mini-series ever made in my book . The performances are uniformly good , from Meryl Streep to Joseph Bottoms and from James Wood to David Warner . All have to be praised . The actors were so involved Michael Moriarty ( who portrays Erik Dorf ) said that he cried after playing the Xmas party scene . Marta Dorf ( Deborah Norton ) epitomizes the Neo-Nazi we may encounter even today : she never believed that her husband was wrong " let's light a candle for his soul , children " and she never will , whereas Dorf perhaps understood his crimes when he saw the photographs in the American officer's office . " Holocaust " is full of great scenes , but I think it should be reserved for students over 12 , because some moments are unbearable . It should be shown in every secondary school in the world . A deeply moving sequence shows Berta Weiss ( the marvelous Rosemary Harris ) saying goodbye to her pupils : she urges them to become educated persons ; she leaves them with sweet memories of " the taming of the shrew " and with a song she could not even sing one last time with them . If you should see only one mini-series , it would have to be this one . A must .
human imagination is free , man is not . . .	Luis Bunuel : " I had a dream in which a cloud cut the moon and a shaving knife wounded an eye " Salvador Dali : " Well , me , I had a dream in which I saw a hand full of ants . . . What if we made a film with this as a starting point ? It's from this conversation between Bunuel and Dali that the genesis of " un Chien Andalou " ( 1929 ) was created . Written in less than a week , shot with a rather paltry budget , it's virtually impossible to tell this ground-breaking short film . It occupies a prominent place in the category of movies which one can watch more than one can tell them . By elaborating this unsettling piece of work which came aside as a shock in the late of the twenties , the two young men's thrust was to accept any image or idea and to exclude cultural , psychological or rational explanation . In short , to advocate the freedom of human imagination ( hence the title of my review ) and in a way to forehead what's going on in human unconscious . These are two fundamental premises of the philosophy of surrealism and Bunuel , here applied them with gusto . He will tap again in several of his subsequent works surrealistic features in masterpieces like " le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie " ( 1972 ) or " le Fantome de la Liberte " ( 1974 ) . " un Chien Andalou " is the first true screening of surrealism . Everything breathes nonsense and extracted from the mysterious depths of human mind . Furthermore , one just has to read the title of Bunuel's piece of work to be introduced to surrealism : it is of a tasty insignificance . The narrative marks are abolished by the presence in disorder of black cardboards such as " 7 years later " or " the following spring . . . " . An absence of story , only a sequel of mostly outlandish and vaguely eerie images , no logical link between them . However , " un Chien Andalou " like surrealism derives a part of its influence from Freud's theses who contended that orgasm was a sort of small death and that explains why Bunuel shows to the audience a close-up of Pierre Batcheff with a head's corpse . It's not by chance if I mention this detail . It's his very first passage behind the camera and " un Chien Andalou " already contains a few seeds which will contribute to Bunuel's recognizable trademark . If , here religion is absent , the topic of the desire is well here . It is one of the strengths of human unconscious and was deeply construed by Freud . In Bunuel's short movie , it is protracted by the unsuccessful attempts from Batcheff to have sexual relationships with the involved woman . The latter is perceived as an object as the shot in which Batcheff strokes her breasts and the one which shows her headless body testify . Man can't escape his drives in his interior world , nor can he achieve them . It's a frustrated love . Moreover , Batcheff desires the woman but he drags behind him in the literal sense , traces from his past with these dead donkeys on the piano . All right , I said earlier that Bunuel didn't want to include any explanation to what was seen on the film but we can interpret the film in our own way and to come back to the traces , they can be construed as a result of a repressive education and a faded culture which stop the man from fulfilling his most intimate desires . At last , the cine buff will have surely noticed that Bunuel himself sharpens the blade which will be used for the famous scene of the eye cut with a razor blade . " une Chien Andalou " is the first work of a series of treasures which will crown Bunuel as one of the most important filmmakers of the twentieth century and it will have a deep impact in his career , in the cinema and even in rock : the aficionados of the Pixies may know that the leader Black Francis penned the lyrics of " Debaser " in " Doolittle " ( 1989 ) from Bunuel's debut : " got me a movie / slicing up eyeballs / don't know about you but I am un chien Andalusia " .

And with him , the French cinema regained all that he had lost with the nouvelle vague : magnificent cinematography ( I urge everybody to see this film in a movie theater ) , elaborate screenplays , Clouzot's Renoir's and Duvivier's bite , all that made once the French cinema great . " Le juge et l'assassin " is his sophomore effort , after " l'horloger de Saint - Paul " , but it was one which firmly and finally placed Tavernier among the greatest , most ambitious artists of the French cinema . First of all , he did with Michel Galabru - who used to play in mediocre comedies - what Claude Chabrol did with Jean Yanne ( " le boucher " " que la bete meure " ) : this actor is playing his lifetime part , revealing a talent which one would never expect from him . France , end of the nineteenth century ; anti-Semitism is rampant : twice , a poster appears : " La croix ( the cross ) : a paper against the Jews as no one can " ; Brialy's character : " we all need an outlet for our bad deeds : I have chosen the Jews , because it's safe " ; Renée Faure , the judge's good mother , serving the " mercy bouillon " to the Poor , provided that they sign a petition against captain Dreyfus . After the 1870 war , France was humiliated and the song a buck officer sings speaks volumes about the loss of Alsace and Lorraine . A world which Zola - whose books were burned - depicted , where 2 , 500 children died in the coal mines . . . The killer killed 12 of them . . This is not a serial killer who comes out of the blue . Tavernier takes time to describe his mind : he was bitten by a rabid dog ( or more like as one scene in a church tells us , he was raped by a priest ) , he served in the army but was discharged , and mainly the girl he loved did not want him anymore . He tried to kill her and to take his own life but he failed twice , and in the asylum , they wrecked his brain . Although he is a killer , he is actually a political prisoner : he realized that as far his crimes were concerned , the blame had to be put on a criminal society : in a remarkable scene , the judge's mother reads the reports concerning the awful crimes as if she ' s reading the tittle-tattle of the town . The serial killer identifies himself with Jesus and Joan of Arc . . . In direct contrast to hîm , we have the judge : admirably portrayed by Tavernier's favourite actor , Philippe Noiret , he epitomizes the bourgeoisie , the man who wants to keep the world as it is ; this is a very complex opaque character : nearing 50 , he stills lives with his mother , and he's got nasty habits ( see the scene when he buggers Isabelle Huppert ) . There are a lot of things to say about " le juge et l'assassin " : the film successfully recreates the atmosphere of the period , not only by its hints at Dreyfus , at a country which is bent on revenge , at a Church which feels its power slip away ( the priest thundering against " school without God " , about 10 years after Jules Ferry instituted secular education , and about 10 years before the separation of the Church and the State in France ) . But it even recreates it with its original songs , which is quite a feat . We really feel we are in the time machine , and that's the main reason why Tavernier's movie is so precious : no one can find echoes of the seventies in France , which would have dated and marred the film . Even if the socialists appear at the end of the movie , there's no connection with their impending coming in the eighties . A masterpiece , Tavernier's best film along with " la vie et rien d'autre " .
And a time to praise . . .	Yes a time to praise Douglas Sirk , this magnificent director , too often forgotten ! This movie is arguably his masterpiece . He used to work in Germany before making a career in the USA , and this war that tore apart his adoptive homeland would necessary urge him to express his pacifism . So , he adapted Erich Maria Remarque , whose books were burned by the Nazis and who plays a part in the movie . Some people said the title was melodramatic and dumb . On the contrary , it indicates that Ernst's and Elisabeth's happiness will be short-lived , so every moment is to be treasured , and we know their love will never know a humdrum mediocrity . Sirk's camera circles round calcined beams , ruined houses , nightmare landscapes . A sublime shot shows a hearse that stands still in a desert street , while inhabitants take refuge in the shelters . A subplot is downright fascinating ; Ernst meets up with an old friend again : this friend is rather dumb , good to nothing , but he lives in a luxury flat , having taken advantage of the nazi rising . Later , Louis Malle will focus his whole film on such a character in " Lacombe Lucien " . Compare the buddy's attitude with that of Elisabeth when Ernst wants to give her some food . She refuses so proudly he's forced to give it to a whore . Back to the front , Ernst will meet death in a very absurd way : understanding - like Elisabeth before him - the atrocity and the stupidity of the war he's waging , he tries to help Russian partisans and his fate is sealed . He tries , in a last gesture , to catch his wife's letter that the current sweeps along . Superb . ( compare with the ending of Remarque's " all quiet on the western front " made by Lewis Milestone ) NB . Sirk's son was probably killed in Russia and the final scenes might tell what had happened to him ; Sirk's first wife forced his boy to join the Nazi , partly out of revenge cause Detlef Sierck ' s second wife was a Jew .
La Tête Contre Les Murs	After his shorts , Georges Franju made three classics : " La Tête Contre Les Murs " " Les Yeux Sans Visage " and this one . " Therèse Desqueyroux " , based on a celebrated novel by François Mauriac ( the writer wrote the screenplay of the film ) strongly recalls Franju's first masterpiece " La Tete Contre Les Murs " . Both Thérèse and François rebel against a hypocrite society whose sole concern is to keep up appearances . François is confined to a mental hospital ; Thérèse is forced to live in an isolated house , in the middle of a forest the trees of which are like bars of a cage . Franju's use of the nature , of the trees , of the leaves , of the Landais landscape is really breath-taking . Nobody can understand Thérèse but her cousin's boyfriend ( Samy Frey ) : the long conversation they have in the forest is the only moment in the whole movie when Thérèse COMMUNICATES with another human being . Her cousin , Anne ( Edith Scob , Franju's favorite actress ) is too superficial , too conformist ( even in her love affair ) and finally too preoccupied with her own interests to be someone the heroine could rely on . After the young intellectual has left , Thérèse is definitively alone . Emmanuelle Riva is one of the ten ( maybe five ) greatest French actresses of all time . As Roger Boussinot wrote : " Unfortunately for her and her carer , she ' s that kind of artist who cannot survive mediocre cinematographic ambitions " . Her best parts were , besides " Therese Desqueyroux " , " Hiroshima Mon Amour ' , " Kapo " and " Leon Morin Prêtre " and " Thomas l'Imposteur " , another Franju movie , actually his last important work . She even transcended Cayatte ' s conventional art in " Les Risques Du Métier " . Philippe Noiret , playing opposite her , portrays her husband with talent : a man so mean , so spineless , so sexless he is almost frightening . A bourgeois eunuch .
Bunuel's towering achievement .	Bunuel's career was one of the most sensational you could dream of . At least ten of his movies are among my favorites and ten others are not far behind . Once he said : " when I was young and I was watching the sky and saying : " it's beautiful up there and there's nothing ; now , I simply say : " it's beautiful " Atheism had turned into agnosticism . Perhaps so , but Bunuel's favorite targets are still here . The bishop and the army are here to stay ; they already were in " l'âge d'or " ( 1930 ) " DIscreet charm " is a comprehensive work : it includes almost everything that made Bunuel the genius every cine buff loves ; his permanent features are all included : these bourgeois walking on an endless road are the same who were locked up in the house in " el angel exterminador " ; Rabal trying to catch one more peace of meat is like the men who were fighting for water in " el angel " . THe selfishness of the bourgeoisie is given a stunning treatment : the impossibility to get a good meal . Bunuel explodes certitudes and he explodes different genres . One of them is the light comedy with its adulteries , its mistaken identities and its contretemps . and if the message is not clear enough , one of the scenes shows the characters on a stage ! Another one is the horror and fantasy film : the young boy's mother asking him to kill his father ( who is actually not his parent ) ; and most of all the soldier's dream which could provide the substance for at least a whole movie . Dreamlike sequences are Bunuel's forte . He has sometimes been equaled ( André Delvaux : " un soir un train " ) but never surpassed : just think of Pablo's dream in " los olvidados " ; the Christ on the electric wires in " cela s'appelle l'aurore " ; Séverine's fantasies in " Belle de Jour " ; Rey's head as a bell clapper in " Tristana " . But in " discreet charm " Bunuel seems to connect all the links of the chain and his film becomes a tapestry of Bayeux where dreams and reality follow naturally . " I dreamed , Thevenot says , that Senechal dreamed that he was on a stage and . . . " It ' s " Jacob's ladder " twenty years before that later movie appears . It's also a political movie , but not a work for highbrows . What he did not fully achieved with the spotty " la fièvre monte à El Pao " , and the more interesting " death in the garden " , Bunuel pulls it off with gusto here . The republic ( sic ) of Miranda whose ambassador is none other than Rey is , even if we never see it , depicted in minute lavish detail . Unlike highbrows like Godard who deals out his lecture on Mao in " la chinoise " , Luis Bunuel remains accessible to everybody : we laugh and we laugh a lot when we discover the harsh realities of Miranda Land which has no pyramids , but has Nazis and poverty . Actually it's not that much funny . A word about the cast ; it's perfect : Rey is wonderful as a drug trafficker ambassador who is always afraid to be slain ; Stephane Audran and Jean-Pierre Cassel had teamed up two years before in another attack against bourgeoisie , Chabrol's " la rupture " ; Bulle Ogier , for once , forgets her usual parts who give the non-intellectual terrible headaches and manages to stay very natural ; Claude Piéplu and his inimitable voice ( make sure you hear his voice : nobody can dub him successfully ) portrays a colorful colonel who tells the ambassador home truth and literally invades Audran's house with his staff and has lunch with the guests ( a meal where the bourgeois , the Church and the Army eat together is something to watch ) . But for me the stand-out is feminist Delphine Seyrig , with her beaming face , her preciosity and her sweet stupidity . To say that " discreet charm " is a masterpiece is to state the obvious . Maybe Bunuel's tour de force lies in the fact that even in reality , strange things happen and the characters do not seem to be surprised and shocked . . . . as long as their privileges are not called into question . If you should only see one Bunuel film , you had to choose this one . But if you like it , treasures are waiting for you .
to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2003	Let's say it straight away : before " Mystic River " ( 2003 ) , Clint Eastwood's last works had left me a little unsatisfied ; particularly " Blood Work " ( 2002 ) , a watchable thriller with a certain charm but without great originality . But the following year , with " Mystic River " , he made a sensational comeback and quite obviously this movie , which critically and commercially gave a boost to his career is his most accomplished since " Unforgiven " ( 1992 ) . By watching " Mystic River " one can feel that Clint Eastwood , more than ever put a lot of effort into the elaboration of his movie . From a subtle screenplay written by Brian Helgeland who shows that he is a far better scriptwriter than director ( as far as I'm concerned , I hated the rather insipid " A Knight's Tale " 2001 ) , Eastwood develops an absorbing and ingenious directing which contributes in weaving a shady and even stifling by moments atmosphere . On another extent , Eastwood takes back a way that had worked for him in " Blood Work " : favoring calm and patience . And indeed , on an unhurried pace , the film-maker takes all his time to shot the evolution of this detective story . More important , he made this choice for another reason : to do a thorough psychological study of the three main characters . The basis of " Mystic River " consists in a classic detective investigation ( nevertheless passionating in its construction ) doubled with a relevant description of the three main protagonists . To watch " Mystic River " is like to find oneself on the edge of a forest and to disappear into it . The more the movie progresses , the more we discover three heart-broken characters because they are linked by dark events . First , Jimmy Markum ( Sean Penn ) . We learn that he has flirted with violence and has spent a few years in jail but he seems to have become a well-behaved man : he works in a grocery store and regularly goes to church . But the death of his daughter crushed him and he is determined to avenge her . Then , Sean Divine ( Kevin Bacon ) who appears as a reliable and lucid cop but whose private life is hell : he experienced a failed marriage and his wife keeps on harassing him day and night . At last , Dave Boyle ( Tim Robbins ) , a broken father who underwent a deep traumatic experience ( he was kidnapped and raped by two men who claimed to be priests ) . The consequences are terrible : he can't communicate anymore , he can't defend himself anymore and he wanders like a ghostly figure in the streets of his neighborhood . As a matter of fact , this traumatic scene is at the root of the three characters ' misfortunes . Being the very first sequence of the movie , it sets the tone of Clint Eastwood's 24th movie . It presents Jimmy , Sean and Dave playing in a street . The sky is gray , the houses of the neighborhood are bare and austere . The ball which disappears through the manhole may symbolize the loss of childhood . Then , a big black car arrives . One of the men gets out and claims to be a priest ( or does he ? ) . He orders Dave to go into the car and the latter drives away . This moment will haunt the three boys for the rest of the lives and will deeply influence their personality . Roughly , " Mystic River " demonstrates in a conclusive way how such a past dramatic event can influence our present lives . In virtually all the critics I have read , " Mystic River " was hailed for its cast . It's true that Penn , Bacon and Robbins rank among the best American actors of their generation and I think we will never thank Eastwood enough for having reunited them . By giving a lot of depth to their respective characters , one can feel that they were giving their all , which can explain why the movie was shot in a rather short time ( 39 days ) . They may even never battle their dazzling performances . And the rest of the cast is just as equal as the whole , especially the actresses whose female characters have an important role in the story since they influence ( unconsciously or not ) their husbands ' actions and characters . To a third degree , Eastwood's major work is also used to denounce the deceptive superficiality of the appearances , the omnipresence of violence and the credulity of many inhabitants . The film opens with an overview of the neighborhood but doesn't show yet that it is devastated by violence . No matter what the time is . Violence is omnipresence and the fact that it touches younger generations proves that it isn't ready to subside . At last , let's also congratulate Eastwood for the remarkable music he has signed himself with his son . With this music , simplicity rhymes with efficiency . One has just to listen to a few notes to feel an intense emotion inside us . In the middle of all these qualities , there are just minor faults . So , Bacon is a tormented cop due to his disastrous marriage and however , we really don't know what went wrong with his wife . Is it Dave's kidnapping ? Is it his trying job ? This point remains ambiguous . Ambiguous is also the adjective that suits the best to qualify the end of the film . What can mean the gesture Bacon makes to Penn ? But these two points let freely the way to any possible interpretation . The contribution of the crew in Eastwood's work is total and so is my enthusiasm for " Mystic River " . If you haven't seen it yet , go and watch it . You won't regret it . At the age of 73 years old , " grandad " Clint Eastwood is still in great form and given the recent triumph of " Million Dollar Baby " ( 2004 ) , he seems to have decided to bring the house down again in the landscape of American cinema for our greatest pleasure .
French thriller	French thrillers always feature a strong social background : see Claude Chabrol's movies for instance . Such is the case with " Diabolique " . In , say , " Vertigo " ( which , like " Diabolique , was inspired by a Boileau-Narcejac novel ) , the social background is nowhere to be seen ; that doesn't prevent Hitchcock ' s movie from being a masterpiece though . Clouzot's screenplay is much different from the original novel . The action doesn't take place in a lousy school on the paper . Clouzot wanted to be " realistic " , that's why he literally created the two-bit boarding-school and the grotesque teachers . The actors were so good they survived their unbelievable characters . Another significant difference between Clouzot and Hitchcock : the former saves the " surprise " for a final that leaves you on the edge of your seat , the latter-in " Vertigo " - tells the audience the whole truth before the last third , and studies his character - who does not know - and his psychological reactions . Generally , in France , critics favor Hitch over Clouzot , but the two directors can't be compared because their approaches are diametrically opposite . This is not legend . It is fact : this is the greatest French thriller ever . I'm overjoyed when I read all those enthusiastic reviews from abroad after all the negative ones I ' ve read in my native France . Thanks to you , all IMDb users ! !
Christian-Jaque's swansong .	Christian-Jaque was a good director , who gave some of the great films of the French cinema : " les disparus de Saint-Agil " ( 1938 ) " l'assassinat du père noel " ( 1942 ) " boule de suif " ( 1945 ) and " un revenant " ( 1946 ) . From 1950 onwards , he slowly but inexorably degenerated into mediocrity ( with the exception of " Fanfan la Tulipe " and " madame du Barry " and which featured racy lines - and the cheerful ' Si Tous Les Gars Du Monde " 2and you could pronounce him dead well before the coming of the nouvelle vague . But " le Repas des fauves " ( dinner for savages ! ) is a staggering exception , and I hope that some day it will be given the rating it deserves . This is , par excellence the anti-hero movie , and Henri Jeanson , who wrote so many lines in the French cinema , is at his nastiest , abetted by an incredibly good script . During WW2 , seven bourgeois people , who celebrate the twenty-second birthday of one of them's young bubble head wife , revel thanks to the black market , while their compatriots in occupied France are starving . In the street , two German officers are killed . Kaubach , a German officer enters the dining-room and tells them they will take hostages to be shot . And , there's the rub : they will have to choose two of them . The seven cowards are stunned . They are not prepared to become heroes . WW2 does not really matter . It could take place anywhere anytime . The movie deals with human cowardice , stupidity and selfishness . And Jeanson lets his inspiration flow with such lines as : " I'd rather have a dead body on my conscience than be a dead body on someone else's conscience " or " - an enemy is a friend who lies dormant " " but a friend may also be an enemy who lies dormant " . The action takes place almost in real time and looks sometimes like filmed stage production . But the actors are first-class : Francis Blanche , who unfortunately made mediocre farces by the dozen , finds here his lifetime part , a fat mean man who befriends the Germans ; Claude Rich , almost frightening as a philosophy teacher , pretending to be THE hero , because he cannot live in the same world than him anymore ; Claude Nicot , who tries to give his young wife to the German officer ( " the intentions are good ! " ) , and suddenly the movie becomes an update of Maupassant's " Boule de Suif " which Christian - Jaque brilliantly adapted some twenty years before ; the blind man ( Dominique Paturel ) " who has got no reason to live , the poor dear , so why not him ? ; the doctor who tries to convince his pals that he cannot die because his patients do need him ; and the stupid young wife , whose IQ must rate under 60 , played by France Anglade , another clone of Brigitte Bardot ; and finally the onlt person who keeps a certain dignity , a woman whose husband is a prisoner in Germany and who tries to refuse the " game " as she urges his mates to " let the Germans choose their two victims . The plot is marvelously constructed , with a lot of black humor , and what we ' ve got to call suspense . Yes it is Christian-Jaque's great swansong and had Billy Wilder seen it , maybe he would have thought of a remake .
