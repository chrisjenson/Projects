Awful doesn't quite say enough	First question is : Is First Look a " vanity " movie company ? As in , do would-be Steven Spielbergs put their money down to have their hunk-a-junk movies released ? Now THAT would make sense . What doesn't make sense is that someone at First Look would view this awful piece of garbage and actually think it was worth giving money to the maker so this could be released for the public's viewing pleasure . But it's a scary old world anymore so who the heck knows . This little gem begins with a guy and a gal heading out to some cabin in the woods for a weekend getaway and ends up with them getting a flat tire while taking a " short cut " . After deciding to do all kinds of things , like stay in the truck to remain safe and not wander through the woods , they do both anyway and one gets apparently zombie-bit , after which his health begins to decline . Now , as for plot holes and lapses , when the couple get a flat they decide not to wander through the woods in the dark but do it anyway and in less than five minutes they're standing before their cabin . The hospital is apparently convenient , centrally located to the middle of the woods , because they get there pretty easy too considering their truck still has a flat and is out there in the woods somewhere . And later , they raid the hospital for pain medication for the guy ( who's moving pretty spryly at that point , ? ? ) and then they inject pain medication into themselves which is REALLY interesting since how does it work if their blood isn't circulating ? Combine all that with lots of cutesy dialog between them as they lay rotting away in their cabin , and you have something that is both insulting to your intelligence ( if you have any ) and is leaving dust on your laser lens that didn't need to be there . The best part : in the beginning credits the name of the film company is " No One Cares " . . . . now that is the most believable part of this . .
Girls School Snoozer	There are a bunch of Troma movies that I've really enjoyed over the years , not for their fine cinematic quality but because they were so goofy / stupid / bad that they were fun . Not sure what could have possessed them to release this except perhaps that people would buy it and they'd make money ? Because this is bad and then gets worse , and makes little ( if any ) sense . Now some movies are just fine with me for making no sense , but that's because they're weird enough to hold their own weight . This one is just pointless . A bunch of Catholic schoolgirls & a nun go to catalog priceless works of art at some old mansion and get killed one by one . The nun gets sick . Interspersed are the stories of some little boy that got scared by a ghost and is in the hospital , and then flashbacks to the former owner of the mansion and what happened to his niece when he tried to come on to her , 40 years prior . Put this all together and you have a big mess that doesn't make a lick of sense and is a total waste of time . I took one for the team on this one , if you're smart you'll pass on this one .
" 97 On The Vomit Meter " ? Maybe because it's so bad ?	There is a statement on the front cover of " Cannibals " ( the Blue Underground release ) that says " 97 On the Vomit Meter " , supposedly from Joe Bob Briggs . Maybe he had a bad burrito before watching this . Here's Jesus Franco's contribution to the " cannibal craze " of the late 70's and early 80's , and it's a real stinky mess . It begins with some folks heading for an island ( I guess ) on a boat , then cannibals climb on board the boat and eat the wife , and take the daughter & father captive , after also killing ( but not eating ? ) the crew . The father loses an arm but escapes , leaving his young daughter behind . Afterward he begins his long road toward recovery but wants to go back to find his daughter . I have an issue with the cannibals , since they appear to be European in descent and are bi-lingual , at least in this version . The look about as much like a cannibal tribe as Adam and the Ants . Interesting face paint too , Kabuki / Kiss / Split Enz / God-knows-what-all-else . Anyway , back comes the hero and his entourage , in their designer safari outfits , to become easy pickings for the " cannibals " . The feasting scenes are long and badly focused , maybe because we're seeing the actors biting pieces of minute steaks off the " bodies " of the victims , although one scene seems to indicate the we're looking into the empty chest cavity of one poor departed soul . Daddy does find his little girl though , all grown up and immodest for visitors . And then begins a battle over whether she can leave the tribe or not . Bad cannibal movies were better left to the Italians , and thankfully this seems to be Franco's only foray into that sub-genre . Not recommended unless you like trying to figure out what the director was thinking throughout the whole film . .
a desperate move ?	Is the " R " rating on this movie a desperate move to make folks think that it's more " meaty " than all the " PG-13 " ' horror ' movies that are coming out lately ? Well , needless to say I felt that held a bit of hope for this . Of course the previews have all the best parts and don't subject one to the reality of how truly dull this movie is . Nobody would go see it , then , duh ? My buddy & I went to see this yesterday afternoon and we were both very disappointed . There is a lot of " build up " in this movie and what is it building up to ? Who or what is Charlie ? Well , you find out who / what Charlie is , but afterward the movie just goes on and on . Robert DeNiro is totally wasted in this , he's done so many creepy movies over the years but this definitely isn't one of them . The basic storyline is a man & his daughter move upstate NY from NYC after the mother kills herself , and the daughter finds a new friend named Charlie , who seemingly lives in a cave in the woods . Strange things begin to happen around the house , and when they do it's always the fault of Charlie . This could have been a decent supernatural sort of chiller maybe , but instead the makers chose to go a different route , and they didn't pick the road less traveled . A huge disappointment , stars .
Tube Top Double Feature ?	Viewer Discretion Advised is now available on a DVD with " Bacon Head " from Troma . Viewer Discretion Advised is definitely the lesser of these two films but the only one on IMDb , for some reason . After about half an hour of waiting & hoping that this would get better , I stopped it and watched something else . This is a bunch of black-out sketches , none of which are very funny , and I had barely smirked once watching this . There is a government condom patrol , which was mildly amusing , a team of " PRIC's " busting into people's homes to check for proper deployment , but otherwise , bleah . The real gem on this DVD is the OTHER feature Bacon Head , which is fun , weird , funny , and has great music from the Angry Hippos ? Yes really . Viewer Discretion Advised is pretty weak though and not worth your time . .
dumb Don Dohler dreck	If you want to truly experience the magic ( ? ) of Don Dohler , then check out " Alien Factor " or maybe " Fiend " , but not this . Alien Factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy , but " Nightbeast " , which I guess is sort of an updating of Alien Factor , is just plain dumb . Actors sleepwalk through their roles , especially Mr . Monotone sheriff , and the monster is some dumb Halloween-mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative ( but kind of stupid ) looking critters from Alien Factor . A spaceship crashes on Earth and there's a critter inside , of course , who runs around vaporizing people . And ripping off arms , etc . And he has a cool ray gun that he uses to vaporize people too , until it gets shot out of his hand . And that's really about it . " Alien Factor " beats this mess hands down , if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie , check that out instead . And RIP Don Dohler , / 06 .
lots of skin but hard to follow and just plain dull	This is a German film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that , I can't really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is . I can tell you that there's several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip , put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the Goth Kit-Kat Klub , though , and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film . Yeah , there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires , and there's some girl on girl stuff , etc . , but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement . I did rather like the eye-rolling of one of the main housekeepers / devil worshipers , that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil-looking . Was that Wanda the Evil Lesbian ( as billed in the credits ) ? No matter . If you aren't too picky about your lesbian devil worshiping movies , you might like this , otherwise it's pretty dull stuff and I couldn't even finish it , I was so bored . .
the previews looked so good . . . . .	But of course , that's what previews are for , they're carefully edited to show only the best parts of the film and therefore suck ( er ) the potential viewer in . And even though I know better , that's exactly what happened to me . What exactly is it about corn that seems to send people right off the deep end ? It's never any other crops , like wheat , barley , rice . . . but corn seems to have the power to drive folks mad . So , there's the little town of Hope , somewhere in the Midwest , and there's Liz , whose car breaks down , conveniently , and who is forced to stay the night , waiting for a new oil pump . At the local diner , she meets Sarah , a tabloid reporter , who is there to do a story on one Jonas Hathaway , who was a preacher in the late 1800's who decided that screaming sinners nailed to crosses in the cornfields made the best scarecrows . This , until a little girl made it to the town of Liberty , and squealed on him , after which the good folks of Liberty dropped by to give him a taste of his own medicine . And he's supposedly buried in the cornfields . So of course , Hathaway's restless soul is lurking about waiting to possess whomever , and Liz is unfortunate enough to have been chosen as his new bride . And , as usual , the town folks are all in on the joke , etc . etc . etc . Lots of CGI crows for your viewing enjoyment , lots of tired plot devices for your boredom . And lots of reasons to avoid seeing this . , but the previews looked DAMN good .
not-very-interesting revenge flick	I have this movie on a Rhino Collection called " Horrible Horrors " and it's not really a horror movie . A native American dude is sent to a psychiatric institute for leaving 4 of his companions in the desert to die as part of some tribal justice thing . Of course he was tried and committed by white folk so therefore when he escapes he goes after them , and takes them out to the desert for . . . either tribal justice or revenge , you can decide . He leaves these 4 people in the desert to die but they're crafty to some extent and have read their survivalist manuals , apparently , so they make shoes out of dead rabbits , eat cactus , and collect water with a plastic raincoat . Of course , Mr . " I'm Not Insane " is hanging out nearby to make sure they don't wander away from his desired fate for them , but somehow they do manage to decide that they want to live and begin to look for help . None of the characters are particularly likable so there's one big problem there , go ahead and die , the viewer might wish . At one point the head " survivalist guy " Sam , says " it's not over yet " but you'll sure wish it was . Overall it's sort of watchable but in a sort of " I'm too lazy to get up and take it off " way . .
how about " The Sucking " ?	What a mess this is . It begins fairly promisingly but degenerates into dumbness and never manages to get its head above water again . There was some humor to it , and there was some promising events , but I guess someone ran out of ideas and it becomes something like " Alien " in a whore house . Not that this idea sounds bad , but if you watch this ( which I don't recommend ) you'll see . A girl and her boyfriend go to this brothel which is also an ad-hoc abortion clinic and the girl is not wanting to go through with the procedure , but the madam drugs her and does it anyway . The fetus gets flushed down the toilet and because there just happens to be a drum of toxic waste nearby it mutates into this giant baby monster thing with big teeth and revenge on its mind . There are a bunch of other inexplicable things going on like how did the house get covered with a membrane of whatever it is , etc . , but the basic problem is that everyone in the house is trapped . And a critter is stalking them . Yee ha . However , more of the trapped people are killed by each other than by the thing as they squabble and fight . From about the mid-point to the end things go downhill at a rapid clip and then over the ending credits you're shown scenes that have people that weren't even in the movie and things that are / were happening outside the house , which they only showed about once during the course the actual film ? What the hell ? A confusing and ultimately stupid movie , with little in the way of redeeming values . .
good potential story , poor execution	A young , bitchy schoolgirl goes with her dad to East Berlin on holiday ( or something ) to be with him while he does some research . Dad has a new girlfriend in East Berlin , and he and daughter check into dreary hotel , where girl is bored bored bored , and she eventually investigates noises she's been hearing in her room & finds that there's someone hiding in the walls , a " cold room " that was used for kosher meats that fell into disuse when Jews got sent to concentration camps , or something equally as uplifting . But is that someone from THIS time , or from an earlier time ? And is the daughter sliding back and forth between eras , or has she just gone off her rocker ? Surprisingly , you won't care much either way once you've gotten into this , that is , if you haven't turned it off yet . I was interested in seeing how it ended so I stuck around and while overall , there's the bones of a good story here , it's not fleshed out and crumbles . I guess the dreariness goes well with the former East Berlin , before the wall came down and all that , but as for Sunday afternoon viewing , I say . . . . nah . .
it's a freaking musical ?	This is not at all what I expected and I have to say that I squirmed through the whole thing hoping it would get better but alas , it never did . Captain Invincible ( as played by Alan Arkin ) is a faded super-hero , who was the victim of McCarthy-ism and took up residence in Australia to drink himself into a stupor . But as circumstances would have it he's accidentally discovered to have super-powers by a lady cop who takes an interest in him , and them when Mr . Midnight ( Christopher Lee ) is threatening death and destruction , the U . S . Government puts out an APB on Captain Invincible to the world , so that he can be found to come to their rescue . That all doesn't sound too bad , huh ? Yeah , well wait until they start to sing . Not that Christopher Lee singing and dancing with a deadpan look on his face isn't somewhat amusing , but this is chock full of songs and after a while I just wanted to stop the DVD before the end , although I somehow managed to get through it all . This may appeal to some , and it's not without its amusing parts , but I didn't in any way expect that this was a musical and that left me very disappointed . Just one more of those " what were they thinking ? " kind of films , .
what on earth did I just see ?	I saw Silent Hill yesterday & had been very much looking forward to it since seeing the previews a few months ago , despite the fact that someone told me it was based on a video game . I still had great hopes for the movie though , but some time into it when I was waiting for something to happen that " wowed " me , and it never did , I got the sinking feeling that I was watching yet another bomb . The elements for a great movie are all there , and I love the idea of a ghost town where fires from a coal mining disaster still burn underground , and there's some great effects and some great looking scenes but there's a great big something MISSING that I can't quite put my finger on , maybe a coherent story ? I'm not a video game kind of guy so I don't know anything about the game itself , so I don't know if you had to be familiar with the game to understand the movie ? If that's the case then maybe it should have been released just to video or something . I did really like the atmosphere of this and some of the effects are VERY creepy but those were just thrown in here and there for " shock value " , I guess , and provided no insight as to what the hell was going on . From what I could figure , a mom takes her daughter to the town of Silent Hill because the daughter is " disturbed " and always mentions the town's name in her dreams , so mom figures this is the easiest way to confront her fears or something . Makes sense , right ? Only in the movies , I guess . The town is of course a ghost town from coal fires burning below ground for over 30 years and it's off limits but that doesn't stop mom . She's followed by a rather suspicious ( for no good reason ) WV state motorcycle cop too , and they both end up wandering the town looking for the now-missing daughter and find all manner of weirdos and whatever other things are there , evil mutants or something ? Of course dad is not happy about mom's decision to do this either & follows along , encounters more suspicious cops , etc . For a small ghost town there sure a lot of folks wandering around but I guess they're all dead or in some kind of limbo or something , and they all take refuge at the church and yell things about burning witches and stuff . I rather felt in limbo myself . I kept waiting , waiting , for something to happen that actually caused an emotion or fear and yet the film managed to end without that ever happening . I guess maybe this is an acquired taste , or maybe it just sucked . .
Letting the Friedman's go . . . . .	If you like films about nice ( or possibly not so nice ) Jewish families from Great Neck , NY , arguing incessantly and resolving nothing because certain parties are not coming out with things that need to be said , then this is for you . I watched this for perhaps most of the run time and just had to stop it . If I want to listen to a bunch of people argue and resolve nothing , and a bunch of other people that have an answer for everything but don't seem to know anything , then I'll go to work . This is a lot of old corny home movies and then , of course , extended disagreements , so if that sounds appealing to you then have at it . The premise is somewhat intriguing , though , that a seemingly normal upper class sort of family in a nice community can all of a sudden be accused of shocking crimes against children that the father & youngest son may or may not have committed . The father had admitted that he had relations with his brother when they were children that were unnatural but the brother himself says he doesn't remember it . There are former students from the father's computer classes & piano classes that claim to have been molested but then it's pointed out that this went on week after week and nobody ( i . e . , the children ) said anything . The mother isn't too sure about the whole thing and the children point out that she's being very pessimistic about the whole thing . At any rate , to me , this amounted to nothing more than a bunch of people kvetching at each other and it just got to me so much I couldn't watch anymore , not because it was disturbing but because it got on my nerves . If whatever was supposed to have happened was revealed , I'll never know because I was driven to the point of not caring . , ugh !
Why is there a hose and a drain in the middle of the floor ?	For those of you that didn't quite get enough gore from " Hostel " or " Saw " , here's " Live Feed " . A group of young American tourists in some unnamed Asian city are wandering about , seeing butchers slaughter dogs for food and other fun things , when they get the brilliant idea to go hang out in a porno theater . Hey , that's the first thing that I'D do if I were out to see the world , head for a porno theater . This place ( the Venus ) looks quite filthy and disgusting inside but hey , it's a great place to pair off for sexual exploits , etc . The problem is that the creepy old ticket taker locks them all in rooms ( except two of them ) so they can do their thing and they don't know that they're on Candid Camera , for the viewing pleasure of the local sadistic mob boss , since the Venus is apparently his hang-out . And he likes to see torture and snuff , too . There's also a man named Miles who is looking for his brother , who was apparently an undercover cop that was trying to bust up what's going on here , and who has disappeared . There is plenty of nonsensical behavior , like people doing things against human nature . I wouldn't have entered that theater at gunpoint , myself , but these young folks just go on in expecting a good time . Quote from big dumb jock type : " Coke and porno , right on man ! " . Yeah , you'd have to be on drugs to do what these dumb people do , and they get exactly what they had coming to them for being so stupid . This is kind of a rip-off of both " Hostel " and " Vacancy " , and while it's not terrible , it has its moments , it's not all that great either . The location is all very confusing too , as there are strippers that are Caucasian , and even a cop that's an American at one point , so you have to wonder where they're supposed to be , too . Anyway , not terrible but not all that great , .
OK , but see the original 1980 version instead	I first saw " Lathe of Heaven " on PBS in the early 80's , the version with Bruce Davision as George Orr , and I hesitated to watch this version , because I like the other one so much . I did finally find it very cheap though , so picked it up , and while it has its good points , I was still disappointed . First off , the settings look much more like what I would expect , which is a plus . The clothing looks much more like what I would expect too , also a plus . But unfortunately , the story itself seemed to have gotten a bit " watered-down " , to where it was not as effective , and on the overall execution , the film just kind of fell flat . If you don't know the story , George Orr ( Lukas Haas ) is a disturbed young man who claims to be able to change reality with his dreams . Of course , he takes lots of drugs to dampen his ability to dream because he's a bit scared of what he can do , but he's eventually arrested for using someone else's pharmacy card & sent to a psychiatrist ( James Caan ) for " voluntary " treatment . But eventually , Caan understands what George can to & exploits him for his own gains . Meanwhile , George is busy dreaming up plagues to thin the population , etc . Lisa Bonet stars as George's case worker , and while she's OK , she doesn't give a particularly strong performance . This is not terrible , but I would recommend seeing the original instead of this . It's lower budget and ( I think ) made for TV , but still , it is a far better production that this . I can't say if the original is more true to Ursula K . Leguin's book , because I've never read it , but to me it's the ultimate version of this film . .
an amazing film , in many ways , but a good film . . . ?	I've read lots of things about this marvelous piece of work but now I've finally seen it , and boy oh boy . . . . what a film . I guess the whole gist of the thing is that some giant storm hits Thailand and in some way uproots this giant crocodile , although later in the film , some mention is made of this being a mutant due to radioactive waste . So how it got to be big is a toss-up , I reckon . The fact that it IS big ( or is at least attempted to be portrayed as big ) is the problem as it munches its way through little villages and such . There is lots of footage that shows this croc ( k ) tottering along above the palm trees and for close ups , we have an obviously fake looking head , the better to show young topless Thai women getting munched upon , I guess . I think what I liked the best was that the crocodile's eyes light up at night , so it looks like there's a VW floating around out in the water somewhere , therefore : It must be a mutant . I kind of feel like parts of this movie just got skipped right over and it moves from scene to scene with no concept of continuity , but considering the quality of the entire film , it doesn't really matter . At times I thought I was watching a Godzilla re-hash , so remarkable are the special effects , and at other times I thought I was watching something along the lines of " What's Up Tiger Lily ? " since most of the dubbed voices are so ridiculous and inappropriate . Yeah , it is rather obvious this was an attempt to rip-off " Jaws " , but in the hands of someone who may well have been the Thai successor to Ed Wood Jr . it's hardly memorable . Is this good stupid fun ? I thought so . Is this a good movie ? HELL no , but if you like bad cinema you'll probably find plenty to enjoy here . .
inept giant space alien thriller	This has a fairly big-name cast but that doesn't do much to change the fact that this is a rather inept film that features a giant alien creature with burning red eyes that rips people's heads off . Why ? Because that's what it does , I guess . Where did it come from or why is it doing what it's doing ? Never explained . It's just there , and it's messing up life for the folks of L . A . and surrounding areas , not to mention the cops . William Devane plays a novelist whose daughter was killed , and he's missing his usual buzz-cut , and looks rather like a drugged-out rock star here . Cathy Lee Crosby plays a news reporter and Richard Jaeckel plays a burned out cop who is trying to find the killer . There's more filler in this than a school-lunch hamburger , and when the monster does appear it's usually briefly and only long enough for it to claim a trophy , except , at the end , where it stands off against cops and things blow up real good . This is one of those films that will leave you wondering " what the hell did I just watch ? " . .
the viewer may also struggle to avoid a comatose state	Patrick is a young man who has been in a coma for several years and is apparently a ward of the state , or something to that effect . He lies completely still and yet there's something going on with him that's not quite right . It seems that his current state is something to do with killing his mother and her lover in the bathtub with an electric heater and that led up to the way things are now . Along comes a young woman , who takes a nursing job at this hospital , and she picks up rather quickly that this place is rather strange and so is Patrick . Patrick seems to take a shine to her , even if he doesn't show it outwardly , and manages to somehow communicate with her . And through her . Now , it seems Patrick does some out-of-body stuff that threatens the lives of people around her , including a new beau that she is hanging out with . The matron at the hospital is afraid of Patrick and never comes into the room , except of course when the young nurse just happens to be feeling around under the sheets , oops . At any rate the somewhat wacko resident doctor decides to experiment on Patrick and decides his life must be ended but despite Patrick's lack of quality in his life he apparently decides to fight back . Overall this is a rather slow and relatively unexciting film , but it has a certain something to it that kept my interest . Most viewers will probably dislike this because it's not exciting or bloody or anything like that but for strange " horror " I guess it's not bad . Not exactly a classic but I kind of like it for some reason . .
Train Wreck	A good friend of mine has a name for movies like this : it's train wreck . . . . meaning , you can't look away but you want to . He first assigned that name to Grey Gardens , although Grey Gardens is a little more weird & classy than this . Here we have a bunch of sad individuals in a little town near Jacksonville ( Mayport ) that band together to make a horror movie called " Turnabout is Fair Play " . There's a lot of build up to the final 15 minute feature , which isn't shown in its entirety , and some of the journey there is worth the ride , but mostly what we have is a bunch of really sad & depressing characters that don't have much hope in life , although they never seem to give up . We have ( in the trailer park ) a woman that has her deceased pit bull in the freezer , a woman that fancies herself to be a country singer ( snot helps her voice , she says ) and Beanie himself , a definite weirdo . Oh , and a singer / guitarist / Vietnam Vet / grizzled alcoholic , probably the most pathetic of any character here . Although since most of them are pretty pathetic , it's hard to say . We have Larry Parrot , a would be horror writer , who displays his prized possession , the press kit from The Mummy , autographed by Christopher Lee himself . Larry seems to be your classic underachiever , he's apparently a prolific writer but makes his living with his wife , cleaning doctor & dentist's offices . Beanie himself chews up most of the movie , and at some point he takes a drink again ( he's a alcoholic ) and winds up living in the woods . 3 years later , after many changes & Beanie being back on track , the movie is released to a small crowd , and it's never explained how it came to finally be put together , but the crowd seems to enjoy it . They're laughing a lot , but whether or not it was intended to be funny is another question . If you want to see a better movie of this sort , try American Movie , it makes for much better watching and doesn't have this irritating Beanie character in it .
just for the record : that is SO nasty . . . . .	This is a film that I guess you could call a guilty pleasure . I wouldn't expect to EVER see something like this in a movie theater . This is so tasteless , politically incorrect , and disgusting that I felt I should not be laughing at it . . . but I did . Yes , it's pretty funny , actually , and rather gory too , but it does sort of run out of steam toward the end . There's a couple that are hiking in the woods & come across some kind of stream in a cave , and after drinking the water , the guy ( who apparently has Tourette's Syndrome ) sees something on the bottom of the stream that glows that turns him into a zombie , and of course being right there , his girlfriend apparently is transformed too . And this is right in the area of Camp Special Dude , a camp for the mentally and physically handicapped . The counselors at Camp Special Dude are a rather callous & horny bunch , and they're far less interested in their charges than they are in lots of wild sex , especially Mac ( short for Machiavelli ) . When zombies invade Camp Special Dude all hell breaks loose and many of the inhabitants are transformed into zombies , and of course the few that aren't are scrambling for their lives and fighting back . Mac is rather handy with Nunchucks and Todd is rather handy with glue and Popsicle sticks . There's also some tough guy named Eriq , who " got on the wrong bus " and ended up at the camp instead of Boot Camp , who is followed by a young lady with a bicycle helmet , and whose saga drifts in and out of the rest of the action . This is sometimes hilarious , sometimes disgusting , and is sort of a throwback to 80's film making sensibilities at times too . This is fun if you don't take it too seriously and are able to laugh at things that you'd probably be condemned for by your peers . . . . but the humor & the gore seem to lose momentum toward the end . Not a bad indie effort , worth seeing . .
Good 70's drama with apparently no special effects	This is not a bad little 70's flick , one that I'd heard of but never would have sought out , probably , but I just happened to find a used disk in front of my nose for cheap . Good cast : Warren Oates , Harry Dean Stanton , Millie Perkins , and two rather skinny little young men called Ed Begley Jr . & Steve Railsback . Problem is , though , the cockfighting is a bit real , and probably IS real , with plenty of metal spurs and most likely real blood , at least that's what it looks like . . if it was " staged " then it was well done , but it looks rather authentic . Which was a bit nauseating . I don't mind buckets of fake blood but the real thing , well , that's a bit much . Anyway , Warren Oates plays a man who has taken a vow of silence until he wins a big medal . The reason why he's done this is he was losing money right and left because he had two problems . . . one was he drinks too much , the other being he talks too much . So , he works his way through the southern landscape ( Georgia , I believe this is ) , and eventually , after much trial , tribulation , and dead game cocks , he wins a medal , after which he speaks again . It's overall not a bad film , has a good 70's feel to it and plenty of odd characters that add entertainment value , but I guess I'm just not much into watching two animals fight to the death . .
pretty funny for a " serious " movie	Herschell Gordon Lewis changed his pace a bit with this biker chick flick , and while it's not necessarily successful as an " action adventure " movie or a " drama " , it does provide tons of unintentional hilarity because it's just so freaking bad . It begins with a young lady driving away from her house where her mom says good bye , she's holding her proper " overnight bag " and all , just right for a visit to someone , but of course she pulls into some garage and emerges in some skimpy little outfit on a motorcycle and off she goes to find the rest of the gang . Now , the gang is called The Man Eaters and they all have these spiffy vests with a pink cat with a bow-tie on the back . Some of these ladies look a bit rough . You can tell by the plastic-tipped cigars they smoke . One , called Whitey ( I think ) is about 250 pounds and has braided blonde hair . There's a bit of role reversal as these appear to be female chauvinist pigs who treat men as though they were " slabs of meat " . Anyway , they do a lot of riding around on their motorcycles in the Florida sun , and they even have a couple of fully clothed orgies , or perhaps they're merely heavy petting sessions . The first " orgy " is accompanied by what was perhaps meant to be groovy music but sounds like it's a game show theme . There's some pretty rough language in this too , like " you know what " in reference to penis , and frequent use of the word " mother " without the usual follow-on , so these are at least well mannered scum , to a point . Anyway the girls run afoul of a guy-gang and are set up for a big battle , and that's about it . If you enjoy really trashy silly movies then look no further , if you're in the mood for something substantial and meaningful , keep looking . I found plenty to entertain in this but none of it was probably intentional . .
obscure Florida vampire flick	Vampires , in Florida ? Well , it is Jacksonville , so almost not really even Florida . This story concerns the curse of the De Lorca family , which has something to do with the occult and vampires , and apparently rounding up a few young ladies to lure back to the ancestral mansion is a good way to make sure that curse is carried on , because one must bear a child , apparently . Beyond that I was quite lost , actually , because this has a high level of incoherence but is still someone interesting to watch despite its flaws . There's also a fortune teller , and some beast from the beyond , which sort of looks like a cross between a werewolf and an ape . That must be the occult part , because it doesn't seem very much in the vampire vein ( so to speak ) . Anyway , for a no-budget film with a no-name cast it's not totally abysmal , but it's not exactly top-notch either . Just another low-budget 70's obscurity that's worth at least a look , if not for the scares , at least for the " huh ? " value . .
a film only a mummy could love	This is a rather odd attempt ( I guess ) at capitalizing on the popularity of Dawn of the Dead and mixing it up with your garden-variety mummy curse sort of flick , and it misses more often than it hits , but it does pick up a bit towards the end and the mummies are suitably creepy as they munch on hapless fashion models and Egyptians alike . Maybe part of the problem is that it's more a mix of " Blood Feast " and Dawn of the Dead , or at least the mentality of " Blood Feast " , sub-par acting , trashy looking sets , etc . The story is basically that a bunch of fashion models and their sadistic photographer have gone on a shoot in Egypt when then accidentally stumble across tomb robbers , an American slime ball and his compatriots , and then they wander into the tomb and decide this is the ideal place to shoot . Of course they're wrong , and there's a crazy old woman who is always around to let them know , at least for a while . The mummy that's cursed has a name that comes off the tongues of those who know him sounding a lot like " Superman " but I'm sure that's not it , no blue tights or red cape are in evidence . Overall this is a fairly muddled mess , but some parts were much better than others , and evil cannibal mummies , well , now I ask you : who could resist ? Well , OK , maybe lots of people could , and should . .
Got your drool cup on ?	Hey now , let me first say that this ( to me , anyway ) wasn't as terrible as I'd heard / read , it would all depend on what one likes and how much value they place on slick movie making and professional sets , because there's none of that here . First comes an introduction by Zacherle , who invites you to strap on your drool cup ( " I've got mine " ) and it's a little Dixie cup with a piece of elastic . . . . and then we're off , and what we have here is mad scientist with vampires and a double decker monster , along with an overly concerned daughter , a hunchbacked assistant who poses as a prostitute to lure in fresh meat , and oodles of other z-grade stuff . The sets are a wonder to behold , mostly either painted or weird , off-kilter stuff like in " Dr . Caligari " , if you've ever seen that . Giant cardboard telephones are everywhere , with real cords . . . ? At times this resembles a tinted horror movie from the 20's , which may have been the intent , hard to tell . At any rate , yeah , there's not a lot to recommend to any " serious " movie fan here , but this is weird and imaginative enough for a bad movie fan like myself to take some pleasure in . And how many movies have you ever seen where a vampire is being staked and someone gets their thumb in between the hammer & the stake , oweee ! Weird dumb fun , check it out , 6 of 10 stars .
entertaining thriller but not without a few flaws	The Reaping was actually better than what I expected , and I'm a sucker for any movie that takes in rural swampy areas . The small town of Haven ( Louisiana , I guess ) has been experiencing strange phenomena , the first of which being that the river has turned blood red . They enlist the help of former missionary Katherine ( Hillary Swank ) , who comes to the town with her assistant Ben , to investigate . Katherine is a former missionary and now sets out to disprove " religious phenomena " , for when she was in the Sudan she lost her husband and young daughter when they were made a blood sacrifice to end a drought . Yeah , that might be enough to turn anyone away from their faith . Anyway , Doug , who came seeking Katherine's help , has told her that at the beginning of all this , a young boy died mysteriously , just dropped dead , and the townspeople blame a young girl , Loren , for all that is happening . As time passes more strange occurrences take place , which seem to be following the same course of the great plagues that took place in the time of the Pharoahs . Katherine eventually finds Loren & attempts to gain her trust , and finds that perhaps things are not quite what they seem and that perhaps she , herself , has been lured into a situation that is entirely different from the way it was originally presented . This is fairly creepy at times , and the special effects are decent , if not great . At times though , the film is just plain hokey and relies too much on clichés and stereotypes . Overall though , it's better than I expected , and not a bad film for a rainy weekend afternoon . .
Come Out Come Out , Whatever You Are	Yes , I know that's the tag line for the crummy new DeNiro " horror " movie , but it would be appropriate for this too , as little Rosalie and her ( mostly ) unseen friends play in the woods . This has a few chilling moments but kind of gets dragged down here & there by some amateurish acting . A new housekeeper / companion for a family in an isolated area finds that the young daughter has some rather odd quirks to her , in that she visits the local graveyard in the middle of the night and shares moments of hilarity with her father over grave ( no pun intended ) matters . Seems that Rosalie also has some powers , powers that are not exactly for the good of mankind , either . She has her little friends do bad things , like kill nosy neighbors and such . Overall , this has a good feeling and atmosphere to it , but it drags in spots and once Rosalie's little friends come out to play and you see them , the scene seems to go on forever and they didn't have a graceful way of ending the film . This is decent , and worth seeing once , but I don't think I'd call it an obscure gem .
Not bad but not terribly original	I've been watching a great deal of foreign horror movies lately , mostly Asian , and lately I've been on a " Korean " kick . I hate to say it but I think they're kind of stealing from the Japanese for the most part . At any rate , Whispering Corridors is good and effective , and well made , but not terribly original . After a teacher seemingly commits suicide , other strange things begin to happen at a school , which is supposedly haunted by a girl that committed suicide years ago . This is fairly odd and creepy and some of the movements within the film make you think for a moment there's something wrong with the disk but no , it's just the movie . It's an adequate and effective ghost story , but nothing to get too excited about . .
strange & obscure Italian horror from the late 80's deserves a look	Professor Alan Whitmore has been sent to Hungary to collaborate with a professor there on some special project involving an ancient cult , or some such thing . While there he finds the professor has had a nervous breakdown & says strange things . Before he knows it , Whitmore has been " sucked into the vortex " of odd things happening , and there are mysterious disappearances taking place at this strange hotel in which he is staying . Further investigation reveals the ancient cult , known as The Weavers , to have some kind of " spider thing " going on , and that there are cult members everywhere , which is evidenced by the odd tattoos they all have . The " mystery " is well-shrouded throughout the film and not revealed until fairly late in the film , although there's plenty of strange goings-on to keep your interest until then . Budpest makes a great place to make a horror film , with deserted streets that are creepy even in broad daylight . When the mystery is finally revealed there are some stop-motion special effects that seem a tad hokey but that's only a minor complaint . There is a feeling of dread throughout the film that is well maintained , and that's a big plus . Strange this is so obscure , because it's well worth seeing and fits well into the Italian horror niche of the 80's . Worth seeing if you can dig up a copy somewhere . .
Weird little mix of heist film & horror	Crimson begins with some cool jazzy music so I liked it immediately , but as the film wore on I began to wonder if the music wasn't the best part . We have some thieves pulling a jewel heist and when one does something wrong the alarm is triggered and the cops chase them and when the car turns around at a road block one of the thieves ( Paul Nash , Jacinto Molina , whoever he is here ) gets shot . Now , it seems like he might die but with the help of a drunken doctor and his mad-scientist friend ( and wife ) he is saved , with a part of the brain of some nightclub owner called " The Sadist " . The Sadist is unfortunate in that the gentlemen that kidnapped him lost their knife to remove is head , so to add insult to injury ( or , in this case , death ) , they remove his head using a train , leaving the body for the authorities to find , oops . Once the brain transplant is complete Naschy wants to ravage any woman that comes near him , because he now has the mindset of his donor . Well , of course this is all pretty improbable and features medical equipment that looks to have been purchased at Radio Shack , and overall it's pretty cheesy and sleazy . But , it has a good early 70's look and feel to it and the music is cool . This isn't so much a horror movie but more a thriller with lots of thugs battling it out over turf and babes and other thug-type things , but it's strangely entertaining in ways I can't begin to describe . .
Buried treasure	OK , this isn't exactly buried treasure , but it's a fun little movie that's reminiscent of Blood Feast , and other such films , but it's more played for ( intentional ) laughs than Blood Feast . Seems like there's this motorcycle gang , two of whom are restaurant owners and one who's the local undertaker , who drum up new business for both of them in ways that are not generally recommended ( especially by the law ) . There seems to be a method to the madness of the restaurant owners in choosing their victims , because there is some " truth in advertising " to their daily specials , even if they aren't quite what folks might expect . It's got the groovy 60's music going on , and even throws in a fad or two of the day ( skateboarding and trading stamps ) . This is a rather short film , probably shown at a drive-in double feature , and it would have been right at home there . While this is intentionally cheesy and schlocky , it's also pretty macabre in some ways and some scenes are played very well , like the music underscoring the undertaker pursuing a young lady on the stairs towards the end . No work of cinematic genius but good cheesy fun .
Teenage Head ?	It's been a long time since I last saw this and I don't remember the band Teenage Head being in it , it's not quite the nihilistic sort of band I'd expect but maybe Fear wasn't available for the concert scenes ? But anyway , now Class of 1984 is available on DVD for your viewing pleasure and it's about school kids out of control , and I'm not talking just late for class . Drugs , violence , and just plain evil behavior is the rule , and the teachers carry weapons . There's even a metal detector , which they do actually have in some schools now . The idea is that a new teacher ( Perry King ) has come to teach band and immediately runs afoul of Stegman ( Vince Van Patten ) and his gang , and this leads to an ever-escalating battle that culminates with King's wife being kidnapped . Roddy McDowell plays a mild-mannered biology teacher that flips out and runs kids down on the street after his lab is broken into and his precious animals are killed . Stephan Angrim ( from Fear No Evil ) plays a drugged out punk that's part of Van Patten's gang . A decent flick , a bit over the top perhaps but it's a movie , OK ? .
Wow	Reform School Girls is a movie that screams " 80's " when you watch it , so if you like that kind of stuff you'll find something to enjoy in this . Now , Wendy O . Williams may have been a lot of things in her life but she was never overdressed . This is the woman who fronted the Plasmatics , and whose idea of a " cute top " was two pieces of electrical tape . Here , we're asked to believe that she's a teenager and that's stretching things just a bit but it's still a fun , if stupid , movie . Of course it involves young ladies who've been bad and get sent to reform school . There are plenty of strict rules that the girls must live by but apparently none of them deal with eighties big hair & dangly earrings or makeup . There's a sadistic matron ( Pat Ast ) and an equally sadistic ( but lower-key ) warden ( Sybil Danning ) . And of course the doctor with a heart of gold who wants to protect the girls . Of course there's the usual bickering and cat fights ( and one is even over a cat ) . This is campy , stupid , and implausible , but it's also kind of fun and I enjoyed it , despite all that . Wendy O . may not be a teenager or an actress but she has a certain presence that spices this up and makes it watchable . Pat Ast also does a fine job of overacting as the evil matron . , don't bother to fire up your brain for this one , just leave it in neutral and watch .
marvelous crap	I read somewhere where this marvelous Z-grade Ted V . Mikel's film was the ' inspiration ' for " Charlie's Angels " , and if so , I guess someone was really desperate . This is a fun cheesy exploitation flick but not exactly inspirational . A space shot gets blown up after lift-off and there was a threat that had gone ignored by a senator , and he now feels badly that he didn't look into it further . Now he sends out a cry for help ( after the astronauts blew up ) and the Doll Squad ( led by tough gal Sabrina ) is the squad of choice , I guess . The girls are gathered up but not quickly enough as someone's killing them off as fast as they can be contacted , but luckily the killing is stopped and the squad is formed and ready for action . I guess the scenes where one woman is smoking a cigarette by holding it with her thumb and index finger is supposed to convey the idea that she's no dainty thing , but it doesn't quite fit her hair-do and outfit , oh well . Tura Satana is also one of the girls in the squad but sadly , she's not in the forefront most of the time , like in Astro Zombies and in that other director's film , Faster Pussycat . She was a great exploitation / cult film star but man , she has one scary visage . Luckily she had a personality and presence that overrode that . Anyway , these gals run around , kill bad guys , plant bombs , and do all kinds of cool stuff while wearing matching pant suits and platform boots , perfect for running around the desert . Two of them also stop at a check point and talk to the guards there , who of course stop them , but they get away after offering them cookies and vodka . Yes , vodka , but it's not just any vodka , it has something in it that makes the guards explode from within . Which brings me to the explosions in this movie . They're something akin to an old flashbulb or something like that , things don't so much explode as flash and disappear . Except at the end when buildings blow up , then it looks like a fireworks show superimposed over the buildings . Anyway , this is fairly enjoyable crap , if you're in the mood for some decent unintentional laughs and cheesy entertainment . .
Decent but somewhat confusing	I found this to be a decent enough Korean suspense / revenge flick , but I can't say I was able to follow some of it because I just got too lost . Oh Dae-Su is a sort of normal Korean guy , with a wife and kid , and you see him at the police station where he's been detained for public drunkenness or something . He is pretty wasted , that's for sure . You see one friend of his come to get him and while he's making a call at a phone booth Oh Dae-Su disappears . . . . and reawakens in some kind of hotel room where he's captive for 15 years . When he gets out he ( for some reason ) seems to want vengeance on those that held him and his captor actually doesn't run or hide , he plays cat and mouse with him . The problem with this is that when you find the supposed reason for his being held captive , it seems rather silly , except maybe to the person that did it . Talk about holding a grudge . Oh Dae-Su's relationship with a young woman that takes him in is rather interesting too , because she may be other than what she seems as well , but I would have to watch this again to see if what I thought happened , was how I perceived it , because it does get a bit confusing . OK , maybe it's a LOT confusing . There's some good old fashioned teeth-pulling with a hammer claw , and some fine realistic hand-to-hand combat with 20 against one that comes off with the 20 being on the losing end . . . . ha ha , yeah right . There's also a bit of self-mutilation that was a bit unnecessary in my mind but it's there , ick . Overall I found this to be a good watch although it appears that many other IMDb folks don't agree . . . but I'm not generally influenced by other's opinions . .
Ding dong bell , Santa's in a well . . . . .	" The Christmas Tale " takes place somewhere in Spain in 1985 , and comes off as somewhat of a tribute to many films of the time , like " Goonies " , " Stand By Me " , " Karate Kid " and maybe even " The Pit " , with a dash of " V " perhaps . Some children find a person in a Santa Claus suit at the bottom of an old well , unconscious . As it turns out , this particular Santa is a woman , and one who has just robbed a bank & stolen 2 million pesetas and is considered dangerous . But the kids don't know all that , not yet , anyway . They almost let her out but then two kids that go to the police station see a bulletin while waiting for the officer in charge to stop exchanging recipes with whomever he's speaking to on the phone , and then race back to stop the other kids from letting " Rebecca " out . Eventually the kids get the money from Rebecca , and then the debate is on whether they should tell the police or not . But they let things go on a bit too long and perhaps Rebecca is dead . Or , perhaps she's not , but when they bring the police she's not in the well anymore . Did she just get out in her broken & ill condition ? Or did the boys really resurrect her as a zombie after watching " Zombie Invasion " one too many times ? You'll have to see for yourself . This is a fairly nasty offering from the " 6 Films to Keep You Awake " collection , only the second I've watched to date but the best so far . I do have a soft spot in my heart ( or my head ) for Christmas Horror films , and this is a reasonably decent one . The cruelty and greed of the boys is rather disturbing , yet they're only 12-year olds . Well worth seeing . .
Decent Hammer / Seven Arts thriller	A young couple move to a small village after the husband inherits a cottage from his deceased brother . It seems an idyllic place , but there have been some mysterious deaths there lately , including the brother , and they all seem to have something to do with a local doctor , who seems rather strange , especially when it comes to his young daughter . Harry ( Ray Barret ) and the local pub owner ( Michael Ripper ) begin poking around and find that the victims all seemed to have what appear to be bite marks on them . . . as in , from fangs ? And we're not talking vampires here , although this IS a Hammer film . No , nothing so neat and tidy as vampires . It seems that there's also a mysterious dark-skinned man lurking about , peering in windows , and who has something to do with what's going on . He seems to be in the employ of the doctor , but he also seems to have another purpose . It seems that , while in Asia , there was something to do with a curse , which has been brought back to England , and which is now the reason for the local deaths . I can't really say much more without giving away the plot , but rest assured , our heroes do get to the bottom of things . A decent enough Hammer thriller , with middling special effects , keeping in mind , of course , that this is over 40 years ago . Worth seeing if you enjoy Hammer horror & atmospheric British productions . .
pretty nasty for the time it was made	Assault ! Jack the Ripper , is a violent " pinku " film , made in the mid-70's , and pretty much wipes the floor with any American horror made around the same time . It was a bit ahead of its time , I'd say . A surly waitress sort of befriends ( or dominates ) an introverted pastry chef at the restaurant where they work , and when she coerces him into giving her a ride home in a rain storm , they encounter a young girl in the rain who is apparently insane & uses the convenient icing knife in the back seat to slice herself open . They do manage to get her out of the car but accidentally kill her and hide the body . And I guess , that gets them hot , and an evening of sex ensues , after which there's some great desire to do all this again , with a different victim . The pastry chef is VERY spooky because he's so expressionless , and the waitress is domineering and basically never shuts up . She says they're like husband & wife . OK , well , hubby is so taken with his new hobby he begins to set out on his own and select victims , even in broad daylight , and when SHE finds out , she's of course jealous & wants to join in the fun . Of course , eventually , the waitress finds out what happens to people who hook up with budding psychotics . A very strange and nasty film , mainly because of the time in which it was made . Well done & worth seeing for fans of Asian horror , and predates the American slasher cycle by several years . .
Just a warm-up to Cannibal Holocaust	It was interesting to see Ruggero Deodato in the introduction to this film because he certainly doesn't look like someone that would put out the gut-churning films that he does . It was also interesting to hear that he was very much against the scenes of animals being killed and they were more or less inserted into the movie afterward . I guess he could have insisted they be taken out ? Oh well . As for the film , some folks are headed for the jungle and upon landing their small plane they find out that their people that were stationed there are missing , apparently victims of the local cannibal tribe that lurk in the jungle waiting for Italians to happen along . The researchers have lost a wheel on their plane but when it's been fixed it's too dark to leave , so they hole up in the plane for the night & all might have been well had it not been for the need of Swan , the woman that was with them , to step out of the plane for a pee break . Of course she's dragged away by the natives and the remaining three go in search of her when it's light and quickly become the remaining two . Now these two men build a raft and take off down a river , only to become separated at some rapids when they hit the rocks and one remains . He is hungry and picks the wrong type of mushroom to eat and ends up being caught by another tribe ( not cannibals , I guess ) and imprisoned , and subjected to torture and humiliation . He does manage to escape with the help of a young native woman ( Me Me Lai ) and off they go into the jungle . They do find the other guy though ( Rolf ) and the three of them try to make their way back to the landing strip , although Me Me Lai is frequently trying to lead them away from that area because she knows what lurks in that direction . This isn't bad as far as cannibal / jungle movies go , it does have a couple disgusting scenes but is far eclipsed by Deodato's later film " Cannibal Holocaust " . One thing that this shares with many other Italian Cannibal Operas is that the music chosen ( especially for some of the more gruesome scenes ) is incredibly inappropriate . . lush orchestration more suited to romances or ANYTHING other than scenes of folks getting eviscerated or decapitated . Overall this is a decent jungle cannibal adventure flick , though , and a bit more tolerable than some of Deodato's later gruesome stuff . .
Now on DVD , but does this deserve the " Elvira " treatment ?	What was anyone thinking when it was decided that " La Residencia " ( The House that Screamed ) should be put out as part of Elvira's " Movie Macabre " series , complete with her comments ? Luckily , the film can be watched without Elvira's patter , but still , it's been edited to allow for those little touches of her wit , and there are fades as in when a TV film goes to a commercial . Still though , the quality of the film is good & it IS widescreen , so it isn't a total loss , but this is much too classy of a film to get the Elvira treatment . The story is that of a girl's school in France , run by Lilli Palmer , and the girls are a bit on the " difficult " side , so of course they do things like have sex with the hired help and things like that , all the while covering for each other . Palmer has a " delicate " son too , but he's also a bit curious about the girls and has devised many ways to spy on them , especially while they're in the shower . But some of the girls are disappearing , and why ? Madame thinks it's because they've run away , but none of them have left , not under their own power , anyway . One particular scene of a girl getting stabbed in slow motion is quite effective as the music winds down and she hits the ground , a gout of blood spouting from her mouth . Also quite effective is the scene where one of the girls goes to the woodshed for a " roll in the hay " while the others sit frustrated in embroidery class . . . . with the girl's moans imposed over the scene . Lots of needles thrusting through fabric and even a needle being threaded , no subtle symbolism here . This is a rather slow-moving yet creepy film , and the ending was rather unexpected . The run time on the box shows 114 minutes , and I'm not sure if that's with or without Elvira , but even with I think it's pretty close to the original run time so it's probably not cut . It would be nice to see this in a respectable presentation though , but for now this is all that's commercially available in the US . .
OK , as hideous sun demon movies go . . . .	This is yet another 50's " radiation monster " movie , this time as a hung-over scientist accidentally exposes himself to a substance in a rail car and ends up in the hospital . He doesn't have any radiation burns or other symptoms of radiation poisoning though , but he does turn in to a rubber-suited monster when exposed to the rays of the sun . Eek ! So , of course , he goes and hides away from all mankind in some big house in the middle of nowhere , and occasionally goes bar-hopping and picks up babes . Now , his colleagues from the lab are of course concerned about him and they bring in a specialist but his problem is different ( yes it is ) and he continues to avoid treatment while rampaging around in his sun demon outfit . Not that I'm sure treatment would help . Supposedly this is / was an allegory for alcoholism , and the good doctor Gil sure likes his booze , but that may be reading a bit much into this cheesy monster flick . Who knows though . Taken at face value it's just another rubber-suited monster flick , a monster on the rampage due to radiation , and it never rises above most of the rest of that genre . .
overly long but not without its merits	In Bitter Moon , a young British couple meets an American with a French wife on a cruise . The husband ( Peter Coyote ) takes the British husband ( Hugh Grant ) into his confidence and proceeds to spill is guts over his sordid love affair with his wife , and most of the story is told in flashbacks which shows what led up to where they are now . And it's not an overly pretty or sentimental story , either . Seems that the young lady was devoted to him while he was devoted to debauchery and he did all in his power to get rid of her because she was cramping his style , but an accident which led to his being paralyzed from the waist down brought her back to carry out her own form of vengeance . Overall this is rather long and could have used a bit of editing , but its not without its moments and flashes of twisted humor . I didn't find this to be one of the better Polanski films I've seen and I've seen most of them , but it's still not without its good points and fans will most likely want to see it . .
following along in dear old dad's footsteps	" Hands of the Ripper " starts out with Jack himself doing a dirty deed and like all tired dads at the end of the day , he comes home to his wife and child . Unfortunately for his wife , he seems to have had a bad day & kills her , with their tiny daughter as a witness . Fast forward several years later & daughter Anna has been taken in by a " medium " who holds séances and apparently also has some business going on the side , for she takes money from a Mr . Dysart , member of Parliament and dirty old man , for a roll in the hay with Anna . However , when Anna doesn't seem to be cooperating the medium intervenes only to end up pinned to the door of the room with a fireplace poker , while Mr . Dysart flees the scene . Of course , Dr . Pritchard witnesses the man's flight & investigates , to find the body and assume that it was done by Dysart , although he insists it was sweet little Anna . So Dr . Pritchard takes Anna in and will study her & find out what's wrong with her , so he thinks . This , of course , is a big mistake , because every time Anna sees light reflection off something shiny she has a bit of a personality change and becomes very violent . She's her daddy's little girl , that's for sure . This is a fairly entertaining Hammer period piece and has some fairly nasty gore . The ending was fairly predictable , though , although the setting was fantastic . It's unfortunate that in order to get a " real " DVD of this I had to order a region 0 NTSC disc from Brazil , but it's perfect in color and sound and extremely high quality , for those of you that are interested . .
slithery summer fun but not exactly memorable	Snakes on a Plane is kind of a fun summer movie but I found that a few hours afterward I'd pretty much forgotten all about it . The idea is that there's a young man who has witnessed dirty deeds by some Hawaiian mob type , and is going to LA to testify against the man . To make sure the young witness never reaches his destination there's also a cargo hold full of ( wait for it . . . ) SNAKES , in a time released container , and a little extra something to make them go berserk . We're not talking garter snakes here , either . . . . pit vipers , cobras , sand vipers , mambas , and who knows what else . When the moment comes they swarm everywhere & yep , they're riled all right and are attacking passengers right and left . The snakes are probably all CGI snakes , not real snakes , so no one is apparently in much danger at any time except from the script , which has just a few holes you could fly a plane through . I find it hard to believe that a little boy that was bitten by a cobra just got a swollen hand . Anyway this is full of lots of scenes that will make the viewer jump , and truly begs to have been filmed in 3-D . Some of the snakes are downright nasty and there's one rather LARGE one that came from who knows where that actually seems like it's going to ingest one snippy British guy , oh my . This is a big budget throwback to the disaster movies of yore , especially " Airport " and while it's not terrible it's not great either , but it was kind of fun in a stupid way . Wait until you find out what the qualifications are for the guy that lands the plane . OK summer fun entertainment but not much more . .
good but flawed	The idea behind this film is quite good , actually , but its execution leaves something to be desired . A mysterious fog surrounds the state of California and communication to the outside world is cut off . With that strange fog comes the disappearance of the entire Mexican population . Which , some actually think is great , until they realize the consequences . The idea that a group of people that are taken entirely for granted are suddenly gone is very good , as in no one realizes how good things were until they change drastically . All of a sudden , there's no fresh fruit or vegetables , crops are rotting because there's no one to pick them , and there are plenty of other jobs that there's no one left to do . Including missing school teaches , INS workers , etc . Just in case anyone thinks that they only jobs Mexicans can do is pick produce . The problem with this film is that in some ways it tries to come off as a goofy comedy but doesn't really succeed there . There are a few good lines and situations though , like the wife of a state Senator that says " Why does everyone think that a rich white man that votes against a minority is a racist ? " . Yeah , why ? I lived in California for 23 years and having Mexican people around is a way of life , they're just other people , they have lives and feelings and YES they do a hell of a lot of the work , so I get the idea behind this film , very well , even though that a lot of the work that is portrayed is work that no one else will do . What's really funny is when welfare recipients and prisoners are brought in to pick oranges on one farmer's ranch , they're absolutely worthless . Like I mentioned , the idea behind the film and some of the " statistics " thrown out at the viewer are good , but the film isn't really strong enough to be awesome , it's merely only good . .
decent Spanish horror	Paul Naschy as a ghostly security guard in this is scarier than most of his fur-and-shoe-polish werewolf guises . The story is not unfamiliar , a bunch of kids going to party at an abandoned school . The thing is , that one of these kid's fathers did the same thing years ago but he's now deceased , and the latest group of kids seem to be reliving an event from 23 years ago . This is fairly well done for films of this type , and there's an air of mystery to what's going on because apparently what happened to the kids before is somewhat of a mystery and perhaps the truth wasn't revealed . So no , not just your standard slice and dice . This moves along at a fairly good clip and doesn't let you lose interest like a lot of films do , and the oddball story is compelling enough to keep you interested too , and there's some suspense which is lacking in a lot of films these days . The ending is rather abrupt and I suppose is left mostly to your imagination , but then again it doesn't out-stay its welcome either . , check it out .
Everything you know is wrong	Taken at face value for someone who was not around during the glam era and not familiar with the music , this is a somewhat interesting look at some fictional characters that are obviously supposed to represent certain " stars " of that era . But if you're familiar with the music of that time and have some memories of how weird some of the stars looked and dressed ( like I do ) , this messes with your mind , because one " star " is obviously a David Bowie type , one is obviously an Iggy Pop type , and there's also the music of the era , sometimes by the original artists ( Eno , Roxy Music , etc ) and sometimes covered by others like they were " their " songs . Still , this is visually interesting for the most part , but does linger a bit too much on the excesses of the time and there's more than a few things I could have done without seeing , thank you very much . The idea is that a journalist in 1984 has an assignment to find out whatever happened to Brian Slade , a major force during the " glam rock " period who faked his own death on stage and then disappeared . The journalist hooks up with Slade's ex-wife and so the story is told . Ewan McGregor as " Curt Wild " does a passable Iggy Pop bad boy thing , and actually everyone involved does a pretty good job , but there was a bit too much guy-on-guy stuff for my taste , or perhaps most people's . Overall not bad but somewhat flawed by the excess . .
decent if a bit incoherent	If nightmarish imagery and hallucinogenic atmosphere are your thing , than you'll probably like this . If you enjoyed films like Dante Tomaselli's " Horror " , then this will most likely be right up your alley . If you like cookie-cutter horror and everything has to make sense , you can probably forget about this . Because it doesn't make a lot of sense but it's very cool to watch , for the most part . A band is going to rehearse in an old silent movie theater which has been converted to a studio . The band shows up ( with two girlfriends in tow ) and proceeds to check the place out . The band ( Night Gallery ) is apparently a very tight unit with highly disciplined musicians ( not ) who wander off to do drugs and poke around the place . So the sound guy is waiting on them and then odd things begin to happen . There's little things flitting about at the edge of one's vision , there's a creepy little art gallery in which the pictures seem to change , and they're not wholesome pictures of bowls of fruit , either . Blood is spilled in great quantities , weird things wander about , a guy is bend backwards and yanked under a bed , and little bloody hieroglyphic type things seem to pop up everywhere . Is this all really happening , or is someone there going off their rocker ? Maybe both , hard to say , but still this is pretty creepy and a decent watch , for the adventurous . Acting is not top notch but for a low budget these folks did a pretty good job . Found this for cheap at K-Mart too , a real bargain . .
Lesser known " slasher " flick from the 70's	According to the back of the box on this , this flick was made in 1976 and not released until 1981 , maybe that had something to do with the success of other films like Friday the 13th , etc . ? I can't really say this is a slasher film , though , it's more like a horror / exploitation type flick . A bunch of people from NYC go upstate to witness the building of a boat , which is for a rich stockbroker type . Of course they're not too welcome by the locals and they're being stalked by someone in a weird creepy mask . Now , Willian Sanderson ( " Blade Runner " , etc . ) plays Otis , a rather creepy little dude that is supposed to be working on the boat but he's apparently just kind of hanging out , chewing tobacco and shooting rats , could it be him ? Or could it be the lumber man ? Who knows . We have a strangling / hanging , hat pins though the ears of one guy , and there's some woman tied up over a table saw but she's still alive because the power wasn't on , at least for a while . Is this cheesy and kind of dumb ? Well , yes it is , but it's also kind of fun and has a certain , uh , charm to it , I guess . Depends on how much you like 70's horror flicks , I guess . I like them a lot . , and the Substance DVD isn't bad at all .
A very strange early effort from Argento REVISED for OFFICIAL DVD release	I finally got my hands on a copy of this and watched it last night , and it's not Argento's best or worst , but it's definitely a mystery to me why it's not " officially " released . A rock drummer is embroiled in some mystery after it appears that he's killed a man that seemed to be following him , and a mysterious person with a strange mask apparently also caught his deed on film . For he has received copies of the pictures . Now , there's something going on with his wife ( Mimsy Farmer ) and a house guest or two that seem to get in the way of this crazed killer , as well as a few moments of comedy with a gay private detective and a postman that won't go near their house after being assaulted . This is also full of seminal Argento weirdness , and stylish killings and camera work . Along with a few red herrings and nifty twists . Also most bizarre is the bit about a special laser camera that can film images on a deceased person's retina after death , which comes up with a photograph of what appears to be ( wait for it ) four flies . Sadly though , the print I have is a bit blurry and the sound a bit sub-standard , but still it was interesting to see , and could highly benefit from an official release ( hear that , Anchor Bay ? ) And unfortunately this " warts and all " print was a bit distracting to watch , so I know I didn't get the full impact of the film . Still though , worth seeking out for rabid Argento fans . . Now that " Four Flies On Grey Velvet " has officially been released on DVD in the US , I have to say that the print is beautiful , and clear , but the English track seems to have some surface noise . The Italian track doesn't , it seems , but there are no subtitles , for whatever reason . Upon a second viewing , I still like this film , but it seems to be the most disjointed of all Argento's efforts . It does have some stylized scenes of the killer ( unseen ) wielding various instruments of death with almost comic movements as they are used on the victims , which is something that came up in later films as well , and is a strange and unsettling effect . The new DVD also has a couple scenes that were missing from the US release ( theatrical , I guess , since this was not on home video ) that are presented in the original Italian with English subtitles , and one has to wonder why these scenes were removed , as they are definitely not anything offensive . Still , though , , not Argento's best but still pretty good and despite the crackly sound , the new DVD is worth having .
he's back . . . .	After 22 years in the asylum , Norman Bates is out and has moved back to the very house where it all started years ago . He has gotten a job as a cook's assistant at a local diner where he meets a clumsy young waitress , as played by Meg Tilly . Now , it seems that Tilly's character broke up with her boyfriend & she needs a place to stay , mm , so Norman offers her a room at the Bates Motel . Is this a big mistake ? Why , yes it is , but not in the way that you might think . Norman seems to be suffering from lapses in which bad things happen that seem to fit his pattern from years ago , but is he really back to his old tricks again ? And is Tilly who she claims to be ? Why , no , not at all . Tilly & her mother ( as played by Vera Miles ) were very adamant that Norman not be released , as one of his victims happened to be Mile's sister . And those two are up to no good and trying anything in their power to make sure Norman gets locked up again . Unlike her mother though , Tilly has a conscience and at some point she realizes that what they're doing is wrong , but mom is strong-willed and won't back down . Norman is no help here either , because he's still in the belief that his mom is alive and well , and he keeps hearing her voice . Well , it certainly looks like she's around too , since someone keeps dressing up as her and doing bad things . Eventually things come to a head & Norman comes out smelling like a rose , since the cops have figured out what was going on . But there is a rather strange twist ending tacked on that left things wide open for a sequel , and we of course now know for sure that Norman is still not particularly well . This is a bit over-long , it seemed , but not bad , considering no Hitchcock involved . If you're a fan of the original & Norman , check it out . .
OK early Franco	This is your basic family-with-a-curse flick , starring the ever-present ( at least for Franco's films ) Howard Vernon as a baron suspected of deaths of young ladies in the area of his castle , most notably , the swamp , where his ancestor did his evil deeds many years ago . Of course the police and a news reporter are on the case , and are out to catch someone for these deaths . Decent enough spooky atmosphere , enough red herrings to make you wonder , and ( surprise ! ) nudity , for 1962 , huh , go figure . This isn't bad but it's not great , and you may figure out who the killer is long before it's revealed . It's interesting to see Jesus Franco's older films before he got too " out there " although I do enjoy some of his " out there " stuff as well . .
but how did they get to be vampires ?	This begins with two women in bed , going at it , when the door opens and they're both gunned down . Then , they're vampires ? Hmm , I thought one had to be bitten by a vampire for that to happen , so this was a rather strange start . Anyway , these two women hitch hike along a lonely road and always just need a ride back to their place which is really quite close by , a big creepy manor / castle / something or other . Along comes a young couple who are camping in their trailer , and they wonder about the comings and goings of various people , who always seem to leave but frequently turn up near by in fatal traffic accidents . One man isn't quite so lucky , the vampire named Fran seems to take somewhat of a liking to him and keeps him around to play with . The two women cruising through the forests , graveyards , etc . , in flowing robes and such is pretty interesting to the eye , and there's quite a bit of action less the flowing robes too . Overall though , this is a bit confusing to say the least and why don't they have any fangs ? They do have a well stocked wine cellar though , for well marinated dinner guests , I suppose . Not bad overall but a bit hard to follow . .
not bad , as erotic Frankenstein movies go . . . .	I bought this as ' Ritos De Frankenstein " from Image , yet when it plays the title comes up differently than what's on the box . No matter . This is Jesus Franco's take on the Frankenstein legend so of course you know it'll be different . It's got some incredible scenery ( the castle & grounds ) and some very atmospheric weirdness going on but besides that it's got the usual ' what the hell was he on ? ' stuff like some sect that wanders around in sheets and Melisa the bird woman and Howard Vernon with a silly little goat beard as the evil Cagliostro . It's also got a Frankenstein monster with silver make up , for some reason . This particular Frankenstein monster appeared to be into S & M as he gets into using a whip at one point . Dr . Frankenstein himself has been killed by Melisa the bird woman and daughter Vera takes over but she gets kidnapped by Cagliostro and taken to the nifty castle where she's forced to do the will of the evil one himself . Overall this is more unintentionally goofy than erotic , but it's still kind of a fun watch . Quite a bit better than some of Franco's other stuff I've seen but not top notch , it's still kind of enjoyable in a cheesy and bizarre way . .
if weirdness is your thing , you'll want to check this one out	Malatesta's Carnival of Blood is a movie whose major star seems to be Herve Villachaise , who really only has a small part ( no pun intended ) . However , there's enough else going on here & just plain utter weird nonsense that you won't worry much about the " star power " in this film . Seems that some folks have come to work at a carnival , mom & dad & teenage daughter . This isn't any normal carnival though , it's built over some limestone caverns that house some pretty strange characters , like ghouls , cannibals , and even apparently some kind of macabre chorus that sings lullabies , even though at the time you see them singing I guess you could consider it " dinner music " . Oh , and of course , the new family that comes to work there eventually get invited ( against their will ) to dinner . There really isn't a lot to this that makes sense , but it's OK , there's definitely plenty going on to keep you entertained even though technically this couldn't be called " good " . The claustrophobic feel of the carnival attractions and buildings is a big plus , and this has a surreal feeling to it that may be more attributed to the amateur film-makers than to any actual intent . Still , overall it's not bad , if you like 70's drive-in horror junk you'll probably eat this up . .
Is it cow sh or is it my beloved ?	I have read a lot of comments from folks that say that " Sweet Movie " doesn't make any sense . . . and I'll agree with that , it beats me what the hell it's supposed to be about except for the glaringly obvious . At the beginning we're treated to a " song " by some Polish woman , in which she wails " Is it cow sh , or my beloved ? " So after that auspicious start , we have a Beauty Contest , or maybe it's merely a " virginity " contest , for all these beautiful women are paraded out onto a stage and seated with their feet elevated so a doctor can examine them to ensure that they're still intact . Apparently from there we sort of segue to a very rich man buying one of the contestants ( Ms . Canada , I think ) as his new wife , and marrying her , and taking her home , and attempting to consummate their marriage after swabbing her down with alcohol only to have her become a bit squeamish ( she screams her head off ) when she finds out his penis is gold . After her seeming rejection of this particular object the women is eventually carted off , violated , and dragged off to Paris in a suitcase by a large black man . There she is romanced by a Spanish ( I guess ) singer , has sex on the Eiffel Tower & she & lover-boy get stuck , and after that she somehow ends up in a commune which is not much different from an insane asylum , apparently , as during the evening meal the participants puke , pee , belch , food fight , and those are merely the polite things . Because afterward there's apparently a defecation contest and much celebration to celebrate the winner . . . gasp . And , if you haven't stopped reading by now there's yet another story line interwoven here , that of a young man who has boarded a boat , sort of a " Good Ship Lollipop of Death " with Karl Marx's face on the bow . It seems like men ( or sometimes children ) are lured onto this ship with promises of candy and sex and they may get both but what ISN'T promised is death and that seems to be a regular occurrence here too . There are many parts of this film that are rather hard to watch , and not much seems to be missed by the camera , although at times you'll wish there were a few things that had been left to the imagination . Despite all its faults , which mostly deal with disgusting subject matter , it's also rather fascinating in a " I can't believe I'm watching this " way . Very surreal & has a great look to it , just be prepared to flinch a few times if you watch it . .
decent Korean detective movie	First off , there will be several familiar faces in this , as a lot of the cast is from other recent Korean movies like Lady Vengeance , Whispering Stairs , etc . The time is 1986 and there are murders taking place in a rural area and police are baffled as to who the killer may be , although they do have some suspects that don't seem to be who they're looking for . This is pretty well done and the rural setting is also a big plus to this . There is lots of clue-gathering and stake-outs and plenty of odd characters , including a man that works at a local factory that favors women's underwear ( red , of course ) . The ending is somewhat interesting too , as it takes place many years after the case and is a pretty good indication that something slipped by the police . It's also a little on the long side and sometimes bogs down , but otherwise it's a fairly decent murder mystery and will keep you guessing . .
purty garsh-darn good	Remakes and " re-imaginings " of old films are pretty standard these days , and most that I've seen , with very few exceptions , pretty much stunk , but this , now , 2001 Maniacs , well , this is great ! Very impressive and very well done as far as the humor and the horror all tossed in together . Very strange too that Eli Roth chose to throw in his character ( Grim ) from Cabin Fever as a hitch hiker , along with his dog Captain Mambo . We don't have just 2 adults happening upon the sleepy town of Pleasant Valley here , we have a bunch of kids on their way to party hearty in Florida for spring break , and of course they're given the royal treatment by the townsfolk , not knowing that they're not really looked upon as anything but Yankee BBQ fixings . We have a few modern twists too , like there's a gay guy & a black guy and a Chinese girl , so things are a bit more " exotic " than in the original . Robert Englund does a remarkably low-key job as The Mayor of this fine town , and another cast member from Cabin Fever ( Deputy Winston ) shows up in this too and also plays a rather strange character . Now the story line is more or less the same , as these folks meet their maker a bit early all in the name of good fun . And this is good fun too , a very pleasant ( ? ! ) surprise , this one . Especially since it was apparently direct to video ? .
Pretty weird for its time	Hey now , this is one weird flick for when it was made , about 1977 from what the ending credits said . I'd say it was pretty much " experimental " , because it has some artsy-fartsy moments that are just out of left field . Some people get invited to their high school reunion and upon arriving there are only 6 of them ? But there's lots of food and drink so they party hearty , and good thing too because that's probably the last time they'll ever do it . There's a reason for their choosing , too , one's gay , one's lesbian , one's adulterous , the rest , well , they must have done SOMETHING wrong , I'm not sure exactly what all was going on . Now keep in mind this is a tad hard to follow , but it sure has some inspired weirdness . Various disguises are used by the killer to stalk his victims , and while it's not terribly scary it is pretty interesting to watch , overall . I'd say this won't be to everyone's taste , but if strange horror movies are your calling , give it a look .
Better than what movie books would have one believe	Hey now , I picked this up on DVD , a film that I'd been lusting after for some time but had never been able to find it , and now , well , I've seen it and I have to say it's far better than what my movie books say . A young girl ( the daughter of a gangster ) is living at a church and singing in the choir , proof that good triumphs over evil . Along comes a mysterious letter that says her father the gangster is dying , and to please come . So she packs a bag and sets out to see him one last time . Things don't turn out quite like she expected . Little did she know she was wandering into vampire country . There's a truly creepy little band of vampire children , dressed in bright colors and gypsy & pirate outfits like they were in some hellish version of Peter Pan . There's nasty things that live in the woods , mutated humans that are out for the flesh and blood of whomever wanders nearby . And of course there's Lemora , who is the vampire queen , I guess . A twist ending to this too , one that was quite a surprise to me . This is beautifully filmed and quite colorful given the subject matter . I was very pleased to finally be able to see this and I'd recommend it to any vampire fan .
as you're busy squirming , keep in mind this is an underground movie	This is a nasty ugly movie , complete with junkies shooting up , female impersonators pleasuring themselves with beer bottles , and the on-screen presence of Joe Dallesandro's penis in many scenes , so as you're squirming away if you dare to even watch this , keep in mind it's an underground movie . Joe is a junkie , who lives with a garbage picker , Holly ( played by Holly Woodlawn , and despite the name it's not a woman ) . This movie is not without humor but it's also pretty ugly and unpleasant . Now Holly's apartment is a wonder to behold , furnished with empty picture frames , newel posts , and even a lobster trap as a coffee table . These folks think nothing of picking up a mattress on the street , with no clue as to its origin or cleanliness . Joe even tries to rob a young couple and ends up taking a bath & shooting up in front of them instead , but gets thrown out when he almost OD's . He also meets another young woman who is into acid who claims to be able to find and pick crabs off him so you know this is a class picture . Still , in all , while it takes a while to get going it does finally pick up to where it's watchable , that is , if you're able to deal with the ugly subject matter . Best of all is the scene where Joe & Holly try to get on welfare , because her sister is pregnant and and they're going to do a scam to get the baby . The welfare worker says he can't give them welfare because Joe is a junkie , but IF Holly will sell him her silver shoes he'll let them have it . . . . but Holly just likes those shoes too much . This is a really messed up movie , full of talentless weirdos like most Warhol / Morrissey films , but it does have a certain something to it , along the lines of a car or train wreck , that just keeps you riveted . That is , if you're not so reviled in the first few minutes that you've turned it off . .
what a tangled web we weave	Despite the fact that this is not exactly an uplifting film , I liked it a lot , and believe me , a film doesn't have to be uplifting for me to like it . But some may find it a downer . Cate Blanchett plays a young woman who has kicked the heroin habit and works at a video store in an Asian part of Sydney . The temptation is always around though , and even her brother is into drugs , although their mom doesn't seem to realize it . The brother ( Ray ) lost a leg to an accident a few years earlier that was caused by Jonny , a Vietnamese immigrant who has been living in Canada for a while to " clean up his act " but who still seems rather vague about his life and current activities , with good reason . Tracy ( Blanchett ) has tried to secure a loan at a bank for the expansion of the shop but has been turned down due to her " colorful past " , but she doesn't have the heart to tell her partner Ming . There's also Lionel ( Hugo Weaving ) , a has-been soccer star who is heavy into heroin and also has a rather interesting relationship with his connection , as played by Sam Neill , who seems to prefer to spend his days golfing and having his way with young men . Out of all this seemingly tangled mess comes an offer from Jonny to help Tracy get the money she needs for the shop expansion and it's all seemingly above board because Jonny is a stockbroker . . . . so he says , but in calling at his office she finds otherwise . So some money is removed from Tracy shop with the idea of increasing it by way of a complicated drug deal , which of course doesn't go as planned by any means . This is a rather complicated movie , but well acted and quite interesting , although it doesn't exactly zip along at a breakneck speed . Blanchett is excellent in her role as one who feels trapped in her life but she's not alone in these feelings , by any means . Hugo Weaving is also excellent as the has-been soccer star and former love interest of Tracy , who also has the dubious distinction of getting her onto heroin in the first place , which doesn't exactly make him a hero in her mom's eyes . An excellent drama from down under and well worth seeing . The music is also excellent and provides a rather dream-like quality to the film at times . .
banned from CABLE ?	I own many of Takashi Miike's films so I was rather excited that this was out , and then couldn't find it at Wal Mart . . . . so had to pick it up elsewhere . When I did find it I noticed the " banned from cable broadcast " notice on the box , and wondered why , since I don't HAVE cable and therefore did not know it was banned , or why . When watching it I had to wonder if maybe it was a scene involving torture , where the woman's bladder lets loose , but no , apparently that wasn't it , it was because one character portrayed was an abortionist , and things like that are not done in America , so I supposed that's why . And it is , like a lot of Miike's stuff , not exactly delicately and tastefully handled , it's pretty brutal and disgusting . Still , I rather liked " Imprint " , which is the story of an American who is in search of a prostitute that he fell in love with way back when , who apparently is now dead and he's stuck on this desolate hell-hole of an island with a woman who is deformed , and may or may not be responsible for the other woman's death . If you're a fan of Miike's work you'll probably like this a lot . I think this may be Miike's first effort in English , and as the actors all seem to be Japanese ( with the exception of Billy Drago ) it is rather hard to understand them at times . Still though , this packs a wallop , and it's on a par with much of Miike's more extreme work . .
A rather bold film for 1969 , must have raised a few eyebrows	In seeing some older Japanese films , especially those from the 60's , I have to say that they were FAR ahead of their time . Moju ( Blind Beast ) is definitely one of those , and for 1969 it's actually fairly shocking . Maybe even for now . Michio is a blind sculptor who has kidnapped ( with the help of his mother ) a young model named Aki . He says she is the perfect woman and he wants to have her as a model . Whether she wants to do it or not , for she is held prisoner . Michio has a rather creepy studio , full of sculpted body parts of gargantuan sizes and every wall of the studio seems to be a different part ( Eyes , lips , noses , arms , legs , breasts ) . Reluctantly Aki begins to pose for him but does try to escape , but is stopped by Michio's mother . Eventually when the mother finds them kissing she decides that Aki has to go , for she isn't the type of woman she wants for her son , and while trying to get Aki out the door a scuffle ensues and the mother is killed . Michio and Aki retire to the studio and Aki loses her virginity to Michio , after which they begin a downward spiral into depravity and Aki also begins to go blind . Eventually , when everything else has ceased to excite them , they descend even further by hurting each other , and eventually there's no place else to go but death . This is a rather disturbing and creepy film , and I felt I needed to take a shower afterward . Toward the end when they are both blind and groping their way among the giant human sculptures was probably the most disturbing , for the actors do rather a good job of simulating cave lizards or something of that ilk . This will not be for everyone but for the adventurous , this is a good but disturbing flick . Not a director that I'd like to pose the question to of " where do you get your ideas ? " . .
Creepy & disturbing	First off , why must something always be an answer to something else , instead of being allowed to stand on its own merit ? Like , for instance , the box art on " Dead and Breakfast " proclaimed that it was the " US Answer to Shaun of the Dead " . It's not , and it's no more the answer to Shaun of the Dead than " Boy Meets Girl " is the " British Answer to Man Bites Dog " , as the cover proclaims . I guess people were getting tired of reading box art that said " in the tradition of . . . " ? For Boy Meets Girl is a film that does stand on its own merits and the only resemblance it bears to " Man Bites Dog " is that there's a serial killer that videotapes their own work . A man picks up a woman in a bar and comes home with her , only to regain consciousness strapped to what looks like a dental chair , with no immediate plans for allowing him out of it . Seems like this woman does this frequently , considering the amount of former guests on display at one point . But this woman mysteriously disappears only to be replace by her camera person who is the REAL culprit , apparently . This is not terribly graphic , for the most part , but what is shown is more than plenty to bring plenty of unease to the viewer . Seems this woman was a medical student and perhaps a student of philosophy , sociology , etc . . . . as she puts the victim through a wide range of questioning and torture . The most uncomfortable part was the impromptu surgery in which items were inserted into his body and then the incision sewn shut , which they don't show fully but it's enough to give anyone a serious case of the squirms . This is highly disturbing , and not a bit like Man Bites Dog , which is actually infused with a dark sense of humor that makes it almost goofy at times . . . . this has none of that . My only complaint with the film itself is the dialog is a bit hard to hear at times without cranking up the sound . Otherwise , it's a dark and creepy and disturbing film , not for the squeamish but I give it , proceed with caution .
Some people never change	Jan & Peter are part of the " activist " scene and their thing is to break into the homes of the wealthy , re-arrange the furniture and such , and leave notes ( your days of plenty are numbered , you have too much money , etc . ) . Enter Jule , a young woman who is being evicted from her apartment and who needs a place to stay , so she stays with Jan & Peter for a while . She becomes involved with one of them and goes with him on one of his " break-ins " only to find the house of a man who she's in debt to ( up to her eyeballs ) for wrecking his Mercedes in an accident . They break in and do their thing , but Jule drops her cell phone so they must go back , only to encounter the owner of the home as he unexpectedly comes home , and he recognizes her , so of course they have no options open to them except to kidnap him or he'll call the police on her . They take him ( Hardenberg ) to a remote cabin in the mountains and hold him there , trying to figure out what to do with him . Hardenberg begins to talk with them & they find out that he was once a young idealist just like them , and lived in a commune , and smoked dope , etc . As time passes they relax a bit and almost let down their guard but Hardenberg doesn't get away . Eventually he promises to relieve Jule's debt and they take him back to his home with his promise to not say anything to the cops . The ending to this is almost a shocker which turns comic , because Hardenberg didn't exactly live up to his promise but these kids were smarter than they looked . Recommended , a good little film & very entertaining . .
Hard to believe this was made in 1966	Watching this I find that it's kind of hard to believe it was made in 1966 , and I can't imagine exactly how it was received back then , but seen today this is still an amazing film and while I enjoyed it a lot I think I'd have to watch it again to see if I can pick up a bit more . Mr . Ogata is the main character , and he and his cronies make pornographic films , and what wonderful casts & crews they seem to round up . For anyone that thinks Japan is a polite society where everyone is well mannered , etc . , think again . We even have a young woman cast as a school girl who's a bit " slow " says her dad , well , no , she's retarded . Of course they use her anyway because she's " the right age " . This is a dark black comedy , and features a woman and her two children that Mr . Ogata lives with and supports , and none of them would apparently be the bedrocks of mental health , either . The young man has a thing for his mom , the young girl is rather " wild " , and the woman is not very well , either mentally or physically , it would seem , and keeps the reincarnated spirit of her dead husband in a tank , because he came back as a carp . Mr . Ogata goes about his life in a rather stoic , matter-of-fact way that's so deadpan that it makes the humor in this even better . I did have a bit of trouble keeping up with who was who on occasion because this also jumps time periods a few times as well . There are a few scenes in this that were quite " arty " , I guess you'd say , and the use of music and the stark way they were presented makes them really stand out in my mind . I liked this a lot , but I couldn't say I understood all that was happening or what I was seeing , but with a more careful watch I suppose I would like it even better . I would recommend this to fans of Asian cinema , and maybe even a few more adventurous types . .
great yet disturbing film ( maybe a spoiler or two )	A 14 year old girl turns the tables on a suspected pedophile by meeting him at a coffee bar and coming back to his place . Of course , she's already pegged him from the internet and has tied him to at least one disappearance of a young girl in the area . And she has something planned for him that doesn't at all fit in with HIS plans , and whatever his plans may have been he never has a chance to carry them out . This is a fascinating movie , as this bookish 14 year old drugs & ties up this 32 year old man and proceeds to perform a castration on him so he'll be more cautious about what he does in the future . A scene that will make most male watchers squirm , because it does go on for quite some time but it's of course tastefully handled , as in , no visuals . Or is it all a " mind game " ? You'll have to find out . Of course while the guy was tied up the girl ( Hayley ) has gone through all the file cabinets and cupboards and even found a secret safe that holds what she was looking for , evidence . This is a great movie for a low budget flick , good acting , and it certainly is disturbing in many ways . I thought it would not be playing in this area yet we were able to catch it yesterday in its very limited release , and it was very much worth seeing . Recommended for those with a sense of adventure , the squeamish needn't bother . .
If only it were in 3D for home viewing	I originally saw this in 3D back in the early 80's when the 3D " Craze " had a brief resurgence . In watching this one can certainly tell it was made for 3D as innards are thrust at the screen on poles and dangle enticingly through grates . Ugh . Having said that though , it is , to me , quite a decent movie & definitely the companion-piece to " Blood For Dracula " . Udo Kier plays the Baron , & Arno Juerging once again plays his creepy little side-kick . Juerging is notable for his ability to raise one eyebrow and generally look not particularly sane . This is a rather blood-drenched Frankenstein effort and yet the " monsters " look pretty much like supermodels instead of the usual " bolt through the neck " creation . Also notable are the two creepy little kids , who are apparently the offspring of the Baron and his wife , sister , both ? Yes , I think it's both . The spy on everything they can , every chance they get , and utter hardly a word . Joe Dallesandro does what Joe Dallesandro does in most of Paul Morrisey's movies , he has sex with just about any female he can get his mitts on . This film manages to be stylish and trashy at the same time . It's kind of a black humor take-off on the Frankenstein legend rather than a serious attempt to tell another story in that vein . I enjoyed this a lot , and I feel it's well worth seeing , if you like the films of Paul Morrisey and enjoy Udo Kier ranting and raving . Pretty darn good , I must say , .
Bizarre , surreal , and was there a message here ?	Depending on what kind of film I'm watching , it doesn't always have to make a point , but one wonders if there was supposed to be a message here or if this is just a free-form flow of strangeness . A little girl is slipped postcards by some " nice man in the park " and her parents are incensed when they see them , and it leaves the viewer wondering how obscene they are until they see they're merely postcards of tourist attractions . The little girl's father is having trouble sleeping and there's an endless parade of things through the bedroom : A chicken , a postman , a woman , an . . . emu ? A woman goes to see her dying father in the country and is stranded at an inn with 4 monks who perform a prayer ceremony for her father after which they all end up drinking and playing poker . In perhaps the best segment , a young girl disappears from school and even though she is right there the whole time her parents and the police can't seem to realize it . And so on . . . . This is very interesting to watch but I'm not much for reading things into what I'm watching that may or may not be there . This is certainly well made and fascinating but it actually could be lacking a real point , and not everything must have a point . Seems pretty satirical to me . Apart from Un Chien Andalou , this is really my first Bunuel film , and I'd have to say it was impressive , and I want to see more . 8 of 10 .
the original release is VASTLY different from the US cut	For anyone that's ever seen this in its heavily edited US version , the original version is quite different , with lots of extra footage ( some which is merely there , some which was cut for OBVIOUS reasons ) . The music is also quite different and more menacing and appropriate for a horror movie than the jazzy 80's-style soundtrack that's on the US cut . A bunch of tourists end up on a small island off the coast of Greece and encounter a being who is a crazed cannibal , and of course that's enough to ruin most folk's vacations . Most of these tourist types were just bumming around other islands until they ran across Tisa Farrow , who asked if she could bum a ride to this place as she spends her summers there caring for a young blind girl . It seems as though the young blind girl is the only survivor of some grisly attack not long ago , though , and she isn't doing very well , mentally . Most everyone else on the island seems to be gone as well . This has a decent air of foreboding and is quite nasty in parts , especially the parts that editors didn't want you to see back in the days when it was considered " tasteless " or " too brutal " . Well , it's still that way but you can now view it in uncut form , thanks to the marvels ( ? ) of DVD . I'm referring to the Shriek Show DVD too , Anthropophagus , I have a DVD of the US cut which is now going to be traded in . Gruesome and creepy stuff , and for those of you that like that , you will probably not be disappointed . .
more of a mystery to me that maybe it should have been	Charlotte Rampling plays an author , who writes one " Dorwell " mystery after another , and who seems to be stuck in a rut in her life . Sure , the mysteries are successful to a point , but she's apparently tired of them . Her publisher sends her to his house in France to get a " fresh start " on something new , and she encounters his rather free-spirited daughter there , who shows up unannounced . The daughter seems to enjoy partying and comes home with one guy after another . Of course , Rampling's quiet holiday is turning into anything but . Things seem to change a bit when she finds the daughter's diary and uses it for source material for her book . There may also be something quite sinister going on too as a waiter ( whom the daughter brought home to party one night ) has disappeared and the daughter is acting a bit strange . Overall this is a good mystery thriller , and I guess it's a bit on the erotic side too , yeah OK , there's nudity and stuff . I guess I thought the ending was a bit strange , because I wasn't sure if anything I had thought I was seeing up until that point was true , so that left me a bit mystified . I think this is one I'd have to watch again , and it was good enough for another view . .
fairly chilling science fiction	Colossus is a super-computer created by Dr . Charles Forbin and his team , designed to protect the United States . Colossus one day announces that it has found another system called Guardian , a super-computer created by the U . S . S . R . for the same purpose . Colossus and Guardian link up and after much communication and exchange of data they reach a common ground , with a common language ( known only to these two computer ) and hold the world hostage . Sound scary ? Yes , it is , a bit . Because of security reasons , the link between Guardian and Colossus is broken , after much discussions between the U . S . & the U . S . S . R . , and Colossus gets uppity and launches missiles at the Soviet Union , as does Guardian at the U . S . The missile heading for the U . S . is intercepted but not the one bound for the Soviet Union , and a town and an oil field is destroyed but it's all covered up in the media . Of course there's much alarm between these two countries that they now have these two seemingly out-of-control computers calling the shots , and meetings are held to decide what to do . Dr . Forbin himself is more or less held hostage by Colossus , and tries to work around it by putting dummy warheads in missile silos and overloading the computer with tasks , but alas , nothing seems to get by this super-monster . This is some fairly chilling science fiction , and some decent cold-war scares , as things seem to be getting just a bit out of hand . Not a happy ending to this one either , which makes it all the more chilling . A decent film for science fiction & cold-war movie fans . Lots of familiar faces too ( Marion Ross , William Schallert ) although at the time it wasn't exactly a big-name cast . .
" Lost " Bava film is great ! ( if you like Bava )	Rabid Dogs is about a robbery of the payroll at a pharmaceutical company , in which one of the robbers is killed and the remaining 3 make somewhat of a get-away , although they run out of gas & end up taking a hostage and then ditch THAT car to force their way into a car driven by a middle aged man with a sick child in the back seat . The man explains that he's trying to get the child to a hospital but the robbers have other plans . So begins a long journey into the Italian countryside with Doc , Thirty-two , Blade , and hostage Maria , AKA Greta Garbo to the robbers . This claustrophobic journey is not an easy one for anybody , since Thirty-two and Blade are a bit unrestrained . " Obnoxious pigs " is how Maria describes them , and that's being too kind . As time goes by things get worse for all , yet the sleeping child in the blanket sleeps on and the father is mostly worried about getting the robbers to where they want to go and getting on with what he needs to do . The ending is a fabulous twist that I never saw coming . This is a rather brutal and nasty film but it's well worth seeing for Bava fans and I , myself , was pretty happy with it . .
a real genre bender	According to IMDb this is horror / comedy / drama / sci-fi and yes , it's all of the above but it all mostly works together quite well . A very creative mind ( or set of minds ) was behind this . Oh , and by the way , this is Korean with English subtitles . Most of the movie is wondering if you're merely watching a man that's mentally ill torturing an industrialist or if you're watching a genius that's captured an alien prior to an invasion of earth . Believe me , you're never really sure . Our hero is a former factory worker who takes lots of funny little pills and lives on an isolated mountain farm where he keeps bees and makes mannequins and experiments on people that he suspects are aliens from Andromeda . As it is brought to his attention at one point , most of his experiments seem to indicate that he was wrong in his choices of who should be dissected . Oops . But he supposedly has a " Live One " this time in an industrialist that he and his circus tightrope walking lady-friend kidnapped . Now , the big-wig almost escapes a couple of times , and there's even a detective that's come poking around , but Byung-goo always manages to keep the upper hand on the situation , somehow . The humor in this is pretty dark , and it's such a strange melding of genres and there's so much crammed into it that it almost seems impossible that it could work , but it does . Perhaps if you liked " Wild Zero " and " Repo Man " and films like that , you'll love this . If you aren't much of an Asian cinema fan you might do well to pass on this though , you probably won't enjoy it . And yes , I know " Repo Man " is not an Asian film but this has the feel and a bit of the mentality , and definitely the black humor . , fun , strange , and enjoyable .
a really disgusting movie , with oodles of black humor	What truly makes this movie disgusting is not that Bateman ( Christian Bales ) is a psychotic killer that goes after folks with just about any sharp object he can get his hands on , it's more the scenes where a bunch of young and well to do people compare business cards to see which is the most tasteful , and shell out $500 plus for lunch , all throwing their platinum cards into the tray . For this is a movie about hideous excess of ALL kinds . Bale plays a young man who finds he's an empty shell that can only be filled by killing . During the day he hides behind the mask of a wealthy VP of an ad agency . Most amusing are his " musicology " lectures . I especially like the vigor with which he holds forth on the " genius " of Huey Lewis & The News , all the while donning a rain coat and preparing to ax a rival . This is quite an amazing movie , actually , but it seems to fall apart a bit towards the end , and nothing seems to ever be resolved . Still though , this is quite the excellent psycho movie & if you've never seen it for whatever reason it IS worth seeing . I've read " Less Than Zero " by Brett Easton Ellis , who also authored American Psycho , which I've never read , and " Less than Zero " ( the movie ) turned out to be less than good . I can only wonder how good this book might be now that I've seen this movie . .
Is the " uncut " version worth it ? Yes . . . .	" My Bloody Valentine " has been one of my favorite movies for years , and now I've seen the " uncut " version , freshly released & purchased at Wal Mart , and I have to say it was worth it . There seems to have been a lot of squabbling amongst those who seem to know what should have been in the film , but wasn't , but I haven't seen an actual review from anyone yet . So maybe I'm first ? To begin with , at the beginning , that's different , and so is the end . The scene with dear sweet Mabel , head of the Valentine's Day decorating committee and owner of the local laundromat , is much nastier , when Chief Newby finds her in the dryer . And when Hap , the grouchy bartender , goes to rig something up at the mines to scare the kids and ends up being one of Harry Warden's victims , is much more graphic . And there are a couple of other spots too , but having not seen the film for a while , those are the ones that are extremely noticeable . If anyone has NEVER seen the film , well , the story is that 20 years ago there was a mine disaster on Valentine's Day , where there was a dance but the overseers at the mine left before everyone was out safely , there was an explosion and the sole survivor , one Harry Warden , went crazy & there were lots of deaths . So there hasn't been a Valentine's Day dance in Valentine Bluffs in 20 years . Until now . Mysterious " candy " boxes have shown up with human hearts within , warning against a dance , and when the organizer of the dance is killed , it's canceled , although that doesn't stop a bunch of the miners from having a party at the mine , with , of course , tragic results . For it appears that Harry Warden has returned , although Chief Newby has been unable to determine his whereabouts & it seems rather impossible that he could be out & about after 20 years . This is a different film in that it's Canadian , takes place in a rather different setting from most slasher flicks , and it's not just a bunch of teens . It's also rather suspenseful and even ( especially in the uncut version ) rather horrifying at times . So , is the uncut version worth getting ? Well , in my opinion , yes . This version almost makes it a different film & lends a different tone to it , especially the ending . I don't really care if the alleged " still missing " 7 minutes was included or not , or what it was , this version seems pretty complete to me & I think this is a worthwhile purchase for anyone who likes this film . As for those who are never satisfied and want to see it all , even if it's material that was best left on the cutting room floor , I can't even comment . , and recommended .
Not the top-notch Argento of old , but still pretty good stuff	This begins rather promisingly with a young boy spying on two women in a forest and following them back to an old house where he witnesses them doing things to a chicken that are perhaps above and beyond the call of duty for merely preparing it for dinner , after which they chase him through the woods threatening to kill him . Fast forward 15 years and we find our young hero Julio still has the knack for being nosy , and we find ourselves in rather a Rear Window-type setting of two apartment buildings that face each other . Of course Julio's been spying on the most attractive of the tenants , and she lives with her mother , at least until her mother gets killed . Of course Julio is playing super-sleuth at this point and nosing around . As he pokes and pries he becomes more and more embroiled in the mystery , of course . This is a great little homage to Hitchcock and there are bits and pieces and themes from Hitchcock's movies strewn throughout this whole production , so if you DO like Hitchock you'll definitely get a kick out of that . I know I did . This is by no means as gruesome as some of Argento's previous outings but it was made for Italian TV so that might have something to do with it . If you like Argento & Hitchcock , you'll definitely enjoy this , it's not up to some of Argento's previous work but it's a great little flick and well worth seeing . .
Fun Danish sci-fi / horror kiddie flick	Be forewarned . . . when I say " kiddie flick " I mean it has lots of kids in it , it's not FOR the kiddies , by any means . Unless you like ' em to have lots of nightmares . A substitute teacher is introduced to a class of Danish schoolchildren , and her name is Ulla . Her methods seem a bit unorthodox , as in , she ridicules the children and treats them like dirt . But , she's all sweetness to the parents so they think she's wonderful , and the kids can't seem to get through to their parents that there's something very wrong with Ulla . Carl is a young boy who has lost his mother in a car accident , and he's the first to discover that Ulla is not what she seems , but since he's kind of the class weirdo and outcast because he's wrapped up in his own problems & trauma following the accident , his classmates are reluctant to believe him . But eventually , they do begin to believe him and they spy on Ulla and find that her house contains some pretty strange stuff , all of which is gone when they tell their parents and they all just show up there for a visit . Now , the class is slated to go on a field trip and that's to Paris , so it's said , but the kids don't believe that . Carl's dad is along for the trip though because he's become rather smitten with Ulla and doesn't believe what Carl tries to tell him , even though Ulla has revealed her true self to Carl at dinner one night , very briefly but enough to scare the crap out of him . Anyway , the kids do try to escape but Ulla is very powerful & yet , she's not quite a match for Carl . Overall , this is a fun film and yet a bit creepy at times . The kids are enjoyable , not irritating , and the parents are spot on in their inability to believe the " fantastic " tales their kids are trying to tell them about their new teacher . The effects are fairly minimal but what there is works well . Definitely an enjoyable & entertaining film . Rue Morgue said this was the best of the lot of the " Ghost House " films recently released , and since I've seen a couple clunkers , I guess I can just stop here . .
DVD release of " Who Could Kill A Child ? "	This is a film that I'd been waiting to see for a very long time , and it's finally been released on DVD from Dark Sky Films . The DVD itself is very nice & the print is clean and clear . The story concerns a young couple who are on holiday in a coastal town ( Spain ? ) and are going to a remote island for the balance of their relaxation time . They rent a boat to reach this island , and upon arriving are greeted by several children at the dock who help them to secure their boat & then go back to their play . As the young couple go in search of refreshment and then their hotel , they note the lack of any other people in the village , anyone of adult age , that is . The husband leaves his wife in a bar to go find something to eat & the wife is visited by a young girl , Lourdes , who is rather interested that the wife is pregnant and wants to touch her belly , but then flees when the husband returns . The husband , of course , has encountered no one in his travels , but he doesn't have the camera eye view that the audience at home has . And one is beginning to suspect that things are very wrong here . After eating the couple heads for their hotel & they spot an old man , who is then beaten by a young girl with a big stick , so the husband gets his wife out of the way and moves the man's body so as not to upset her , I guess , and then lies about what happened to assure her . . . he must really want this vacation ! Although , he does begin to have his doubts shortly after when he sees a band of children have strung up the man's body and are playing " pinata " with it , but using a scythe instead of a stick . . . thankfully we're spared the bursting . The couple then decides it's time to get out of Dodge , but it's rather late by then . They do find another adult who has been hiding and he's an ally for a while , but his own daughter lures him into coming home because his wife and mother are sick , supposedly . The conflict in this movie is when it comes to actually killing any of these children because adults just don't do that , although there's plenty of footage at the beginning of the film that shows children suffering in all kinds of horrific conditions from WW2 right up to ( at that time ) the present . Of course , children do get killed but by then it was far to late to be thinking about all that anyway . This is a fairly chilling film because it creates a sense of dread out of virtually nothing , much in the way that Peter Weir does in " Last Wave " or " Picnic at Hanging Rock " and what seems rather ordinary turns out to be one's worst nightmare . A decent 70's chiller and a different kind of horror . . . . far better than things like " Children of the Corn " , which has a similar premise but is not even remotely in the same league . .
" Pull me "	" Funky Forest " is kind of a stream-of-consciousness pastiche of skits and strange ( and sometimes mundane ) little stories . It goes on for about two and a half hours with an intermission , too , which consists of a nearly-blank screen and background music . We have two comedians ( of sorts ) who aren't very funny , one of whom has an Emo Philips hairstyle , and their bits zip in and out of the proceedings , sometimes for only seconds at a time . Also we have The Guitar Brothers , one of whom is Tadanobu Asano , and a tubby little kid , Masao , who looks like Pugsley from the Addams Family . And there are references throughout the film to aliens from Piko-Rico ( spelling ? ) . At some times you feel there ARE aliens involved with this , because there isn't any better explanation . My favorite scenes involve a young school girl who seems what seems to be the tail of a furry creature who has gone around the corner , but when her curiosity leads her to follow , she finds it's not the tail , for it's on the wrong side , and the creature ( which appears to be a man in a furry suit ) begs her to " pull me " . And then , another man in a school kid's uniform appears & they proceed to have the girl insert some kind of tube into her navel which powers some kind of machine that eventually yields a miniature sushi chef . I also like these rather odd and creepy creatures that are treated like they're nothing unusual by the people who handle them , which apparently turn out to be organic band instruments ? They look like something right out of David Cronenberg's mind , back when he made real horror films . Also reminiscent of Cronenberg is the " After School Club " where a young girl with something like a badminton racket proceeds to swing at milk squirted from the extended nipples of a middle-aged man , which is apparently generated by squeezing a bulbous sac that extends out of his anus . And then the girl is attacked by a blood-sucker that has a little man inside . VERY weird stuff , although not presented in way in which it's made to be creepy . This will not be for everyone , especially those who think that things need to make sense and films need to be linear , for this is definitely neither of those things . It is , however , a jaw-dropping festival of weirdness & WTF film making , and is well worth seeing for the adventurous . .
Woody and Bee's Violent Adventure	Bio Zombie is kind of a ' Bill & Ted ' meet " Dawn of the Dead " , Hong Kong-style , and it's actually a pretty decent little film . Zombies are created from drinking spiked soda . Looks like this is something that the Iraqis were selling to the Japanese military so it is possible that George W . Bush was onto something after all , or perhaps he just watched this movie . At any rate , the ever-hapless Woody & " Crazy " Bee go to pick up their boss's car at a repair shop and on the way back hit an officer that has a bottle of this nasty soda in his briefcase , and when he tries to tell them about the " soda " they think he's thirsty and pour it down his throat with results that I'm sure they never dreamed of . They put him in the trunk and bring him back to the mall where they work and of course after that all hell breaks loose after he escapes and bites a security guard , who in turn bites someone else , and you know the rest from there . The mall closes for the day and Woody & Bee & some other workers are trapped in the mall with zombies galore . This is both funny and gory and not terribly scary , but still quite good , and even has a few almost touching moments . This is not top-notch film making but it's very entertaining and well worth seeing . And the option is on the DVD to watch it dubbed in English if you can't handle Cantonese with subtitles . stars , well worth seeing .
great crime thriller , British-style ( minor spoilers )	Will ( Clive Owen ) was apparently a big man in the London underworld of crime , who had given up all he had to go out into the woods & work as a laborer . When his younger brother , Davey ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers ) kills himself , Will doesn't know about it but something has drawn him back to London and when he finds out what's happened , he's vowed to find out why . Davey was apparently dabbling in drug-dealing , and he ran afoul of the wrong people & was " punished " for his crimes , by way of buggery . And Davey couldn't deal with that so he took his own life . Will has contacts , and Will finds out who the culprit is , and takes his time finding the right moment for his appearance . Also in the story is Charlotte Rampling , who used to be Will's lover , I guess , and she tries to talk him out of doing anything that would bring him back into the lifestyle he used to lead . But Will has a mission , and he's not stopping until it's completed . This is a far better film than I expected , and it's definitely a good thriller . In some ways the character of Will reminds me of a Clint Eastwood role , one in which he exacts vengeance on those who wronged him ( or in this case , his family ) . .
Polish Spaniards and other strange tales	This is a rather long but hypnotic film of a Walloon soldier during the Napoleanic wars who seeks to get to Madrid , and encounters many strange people and situations along the way . This is a very surreal film and seems to be somewhat along the lines of Baron Munchausen as channeled through Luis Bunuel or something , although it's much darker than that . Alfons ( our hero ) finds himself waking up by gallows again and again , after either experiencing ghostly situations or just plain dreaming , I'm not sure , but the fact that this keeps happening when the viewer thinks that things are moving towards a certain outcome is rather weird , to say the least . Lots of bones and creepy imagery plus a bit of nudity too , which I find strange for 1965 , especially from what was then a Communist country . Then again , I don't know what was " OK " by the party and what wasn't , I guess they liked some breasts here and there . There are several people that Alfons encounters along the way that have tales to tell and while sometimes this whole film seems rather " talky " , when one reaches the end is certainly worthwhile & will stay with you for days . I liked this but I won't pretend that I understand it . Jerry Garcia supposedly loved this film but we all know what Jerry Garcia did in his spare time . , well worth seeing for the adventurous .
One sucker at a time	Lollilove is a Troma release , and the first thing that struck me about it was that it contained no obnoxious lead-in from Lloyd Kaufman , which was a big plus right there , because he's pretty much about the most annoying human being on the planet any more . But right into this " mockumentary " we go , and it's about a young privileged couple that set out ( naively and cluelessly ) to help the homeless by passing out lollipops with " custom artwork " to help the homeless feel better about themselves . When meeting with another rich young couple to discuss funding they are asked " why don't you just give them this money ? " and they're lacking for a good answer . In some ways this couple seems to be somewhat modeled on the new-age goof balls with the Weimereiner in " Best in Show " who are always arguing with each other over stupid things . Still though , this manages to be a pretty funny spoof of a documentary and this misguided couple stands out as someone that IS actually doing something to help the homeless , no matter how pointless or stupid . The husband is great as the germ-phobic egotistic artist that irritates his wife by " lollygagging " , and when it comes time to pass out the lollipops and he comes to his wife's defense it's awesome to see him get spit on and freak out . I've grown tired of Christopher Guest's efforts anymore so it was kind of refreshing to see someone pick up the reigns and travel in another direction . .
unique & stylish oddball French thriller	There's almost so much going on in " Diva " that it's hard to describe , but I'll give it a try . There's a young postman ( Jules ) who is an opera fan , who has managed to tape his favorite singer , Cynthia Hawkins . There are Taiwanese bootleggers who are on his tail . There's also a cassette tape that was dropped into a pouch on Jules ' moped by a prostitute who was killed to keep her from talking about the fact that she was held captive as part of a slave-trading ring run by a high-ranking public official . There are two thugs ( one whom is Dominic Pinon of " Delicatessen " & other Jeunet & Caro films ) and they're out to make sure the secret on the cassette tape never gets out . So there's two tapes floating around and they keep getting passed around until the pursuers have no idea who has them . Plus , Jules has made advances on his opera singer Cynthia & has gotten to know her much much better , but has not told her he taped her ( she has refused to record & therefore the recording is that much more sought after ) . This is a rather unique film and it's full of twists and turns , and even contains a cool chase scene through the subways on a moped , and has more crosses and double-crosses than you can almost keep up with . A well crafted film and very well thought out , no gaping plot holes and such like the thrown-together crap of today . Recommended if you can find it , sadly , it's now out of print . .
Yeah , sure he did , buddy . . . .	A random set of murders in NYC can only be attributed to one thing : All the assailants say that " God Told Them To " . So of course , they had to listen . Tony Lo Bianco is a good cop on the case and trying to figure out what's going on . There is a common thread in these killings and it's something to do with some guy with long blond hair and a face that nobody remembers . Being that this character is played by Richard Lynch , I find THAT part hard to believe but the reason no one remembers his face is not that it isn't memorable . As the probing goes on , it seems that there was a " virgin " birth back in the early 50's , and a woman claiming to be kidnapped by someone and impregnated . This is a pretty weird and creepy movie , not particularly scary but perhaps more disturbing as it goes on . Seems that Peter , the cop , may not be quite what he thinks he is either . Watch for Andy Kaufman in his first role as a baby-faced cop that goes berserk at a St . Patrick's Day parade and wastes a few people . I've always enjoyed the films of Larry Cohen , at least the earlier ones , and this is one of the best . Check it out , stars .
Great Caesar's Ghost !	I love most 50's science fiction , no matter how good or bad , and I was not disappointed by seeing this for the first time , finally . Scientists find what they think is an asteroid headed for earth and rockets are deployed to destroy it before it reaches earth , but it . . evades them and keeps on coming . Evades them ? An asteroid ? Ah , but this isn't an asteroid , it's more an extraterrestrial Cracker-Jack box with a prize inside . The object narrowly misses New York ( in fact , you can hear it during a live news broadcast from there ) and crashes into the Pacific ( ? ) Ocean , and this team of scientists , who are apparently the only ones on the planet interested in it , head for Mexico to hang out and eat tamales . . . . I mean , what were they going to do , the thing crashed into the ocean . . ? But lucky for them , this thing rises up out of the ocean and the next morning , there's this object that's very tall and very scary , that looks like a big building , standing out near the hut in which they're staying . Of course they hop into their helicopter and land on top of the thing and look around , and then the thing starts MOVING and they flee . This is Kronos , and it's a huge energy sucking robot on the rampage , with seemingly pneumatic feet that propel it along in search of the next power source . It's a little hard to say how the parts of the film with Kronos were done , at times it looks like a cartoon or a painting , but maybe it's stop motion animation ? At any rate , it doesn't look very real , but for the time in which this was made it's not bad . As Kronos heads for LA , one brilliant scientist proves why he makes the big bucks by figuring out how to stop it , of course . This is at times cheesy and somewhat unintentionally funny , but still it's a semi-respectable science fiction film and is not bad if you like this sort of thing . . . as long as you don't think too hard about what you're watching at times . .
meat , madness , & mayhem	This is , without a doubt , one of the stranger movies I've seen lately , but it's actually well done . Therese is a young woman who has a thing for beef , martial arts films & Pastor Dylan ( Walter Koenig , looking rather creepy ) . Or , pretty much any man when Pastor Dylan finally dumps her . She's also a meat inspector & ends up , despite that , with mad cow disease . She's also divorced and has a long list of guys she's slept with that all leave messages on her answering machine . When her mother passes away , she is so lost in her disease and despair that she decides to become the woman she idolizes , The Girl With The Thunderbolt Kick , and go up against the Ten Tigers of Kwan Tang , or something like that , and do watch their names as they appear on your screen , it's hilarious . This strange meld of black comedy , horror , Kung Fu , and who knows what else , is an oddity , but it's also very unlike most modern films because it doesn't stick to any tried and true formula . Apparently filmed in LA but you'll be confused because of various languages spoken , for whatever reason , during the film . , well worth seeing for those with a sense of adventure .
Awesome adult " fairy tale "	Pan's Labyrinth brings to mind Guillermo Del Toro's other Spanish Civil War film , Devi'ls Backbone , because it's a film mostly from a child's point of view and it also incorporates the supernatural , or in this instance , it's more a young girl's obsession with fantasy , to deal with life during war . The young girl and her pregnant mother are going to live with a Captain in the Spanish army , the father of the woman's unborn child , and the daughter does not want to recognize this man as her father , much less go live with him . She has far better instincts than her mother , for this man is sadistic , narcissistic , and his main concern is that he have a son to carry on his name . The young girl is either having dreams , supernatural experiences , or has retreated into a fantasy world where she thinks a she has met a faun in an old labyrinth on the property and has been recognized as a princess and is to carry out three tasks to prove her worthiness . Meanwhile , back at the ranch , Mercedes , the servant , is smuggling out food and medicine to nearby rebels , one of whom is her brother . And Mercedes hates the captain and feels sorry for the young girl and her mother . This is a rather awesome film to watch and the idea of fantasy type creatures out and about during a wartime setting is rather fascinating . One scene has the little girl drawing a door in her room with a piece of chalk and descending into the world of whatever the thing is that's in all the promo's , a creature with its eyes in the palm of it's hands , which is probably the scariest thing in this film , besides the captain , that is . I was shocked to see , here , in Louisville , KY , a FULL THEATER of people when this film ended and everyone started to leave . For this movie is in Spanish with subtitles . I guess not everyone thinks that if it's not in English it doesn't belong here . A movie well worth seeing , .
Wild stuff	In the near future in Japan , with unemployment at a record high and students boycotting classes , we find an unfortunate group of kids that are on their class trip at the end of their compulsory education , who end up on a deserted island , pitted against each other to the last one standing . It's amazing how quickly they change from a bunch of puzzled high school students who are mostly friends , to being suspicious of each other & remembering little slights from the past that might be good things to deal with now that they're armed to the TEETH . Or , at least some of them are . Battle Royale is some act passed to apparently rid the streets of those damn insolent teenagers , who the adults no longer trust . For comparison , try Blackboard Jungle meets Clockwork Orange and Lord of the Flies and maybe a dash of The Most Dangerous Game , but it's really not copying any of those . This is a very compelling watch , and while some of it borders on sappy towards the end , it's still overall a great flick and well worth your time to see . Now if someone would just release it in the US . . . . . . PLEASE ?
Interesting , but drags a bit towards the end	This begins as a bunch of office workers in a drab old building are assigned their work for the week , and in the front of the building you see the clients drifting in from a fog , and going to the receptionist and being told to take their place in the lobby . Then you realize that the people that are showing up there have recently died and this place is a holding area for the afterlife , in which they are told that they must come up with a cherished memory and then in one week they will be allowed to move on . It's not so easy for some , who look back at their lives and can find nothing worth cherishing . Those who can not choose can't move on , and then you find that the counselors there are only there because THEY themselves could not choose , either . There are many touching and interesting moments in this , and the idea is that the cherished memories will then be staged and committed to film , and after viewing the film of their cherished memory the subject is then able to move on . Seems that there's a bit of overlap with one counselor and his subject though , because they had something in common in the way of a woman who became one man's wife after her fiancée was killed in World War II . This is quite good up to a point but then when the staging of the filming of the " cherished memories " begins , the film starts to drag some , and that segment goes on for too long for my taste . Still though , a very good film and food for thought if you're not living your life to its fullest . .
charming romantic comedy	Nekromantik can be taken as sort of a romantic comedy , I suppose , of the darkest , sickest kind , perhaps . We have a man who works on a clean-up crew , showing up to road accidents and such and taking discreet opportunities to collect little bits and pieces of bodies for his collection at home , and his wife or girlfriend apparently shares in his interests . Wholesome , it is not . Now , when an apparent drowning victim is found ( a mostly decayed body ) the young man seizes his opportunity and takes it home much to his significant other's delight , and the two of them get their jollies with the thing , even going so far as to fit it with an appendage to take the place of the one that's now , uh , missing . However , this young man is not well liked at his job and soon loses it , and after that his significant other leaves and takes the play-thing with her , leaving him at rather loose ends to drink , go berserk , and ponder what a messed up life he has . This is no great feat of movie-making but it possesses a certain gritty , uh , charm , I guess , and will probably nauseate and repulse a lot of people . However , if you have a sense of adventure AND a sense of humor , because this is , in a dark way , kind of amusing , then check this out . I rather thought Nektromatik 2 was better and it actually picks up where this one left off , but at that point I guess Jorg Buttgereit perhaps had more experience under his belt so maybe that's part of the reason . Worth seeing but as the disclaimer at the beginning says , NOT TO BE WATCHED BY MINORS , and that's probably a good idea , really it is . .
Awesome over-the-top horror comedy from Spain	Father Angel is a priest and a professor at a small university in Spain , and he's discovered that the Antichrist will be born in Madrid on December 25th so he's off to Madrid to commit all the sin he can to get as close to the un-blessed event as possible , to prevent it . Along the way he manages to pick up a a couple of cohorts , one being a rather dim-witted metal-head who works at a record store , the other being a TV talk show host that pretends to predict the future . Now , Father Angel is sincere in his quest but he also seems a bit naive and sees signs that are perhaps other than he thinks they are , but somehow , with his partners along , despite all the bumbling , it certainly does seem like he's on to something . A summoning is done , using available things like white bread instead of hosts and LSD instead of the preferred mushrooms , and a rather hurried search for virgin's blood also ensues . Meanwhile there's also a gang of creeps out to " Clean Up Madrid " by burning bums and all kinds of other festive goings-on . Of course , despite all his bumbling , Father Angel is perhaps correct , but it's a break-neck race to the finish to find the correct location of the birth and plot side-lines and the main story all collide at once to make a rather spectacular ending and then a rather quiet epilogue . This is at times quite hilarious in a dark comedic way , and Santiago Segura is great as the dim-bulb metal-head . If you're a fan of De La Iglesia and you haven't seen this , please get your mitts on it . Unfortunately it's not available in NTSC Region 1 ( or 0 ) format at this time but given that most of his other stuff is , one can only hope for a decent release sometime soon . .
low-key but high interest vampire flick , of the off-beat kind	I guess Larry Fessenden has been working in films for a while now , but I've really only seen two of his efforts , this and Wendigo , and both are good but this one ( Habit ) is , well , great , I'd say . The story of a guy that has lost his father , just broken up with his girlfriend , and meets a strange but interesting young lady at a Halloween party . Now , Anna is rather mysterious , and won't even tell Sam ( Fessenden ) what she does for a living . The relationship gets even stranger as it goes on too because while the sex is good and steamy Sam always wakes up in strange places with blood missing . Hmm . Of course , Sam begins to not feel too well , and friends are quite concerned . With good reason . This is incredibly well done , and Anna is suitably mysterious , and even appears in what seem to be dream sequences but apparently they're as real as can be . This has an overall low-key approach with an underlying menace and dread , and it's fairly creepy at times . The NYC setting works great with this too . This stands well on its own merits but would probably be a great double feature to watch with " Nadja " . I saw this once a few years ago & liked it enough to chase it down on DVD , so now after seeing it again I'm interested in looking up some of Fessenden's other work . stars , pretty damn good and highly recommended .
very strange and very cool	The more I see the films of Jean Rollin the more I want , well , more . Shiver of the Vampires is probably the strangest of any films by Rollin I've seen yet and it has an " ahead of its time " rock soundtrack which is quite good too . The basic story ( and it is pretty basic ) is that a newly married couple go to visit the wife's eccentric cousins at a castle , only to find the cousins are both recently deceased . Seems they were vampire hunters and now they're vampires . But , the cousin's two strange servant-girls are still at the castle , and they welcome the young couple in to stay , and they allude to the fact that their masters are not gone , and in a way they're correct , but not in the way that the young wife hopes . Of course the young wife is an immediate target for being turned ( into a vampire , that is ) and on their first night a charming goth lesbian vampire comes out of the grandfather clock for a tryst . Beyone that , well , it's kind of standard , plot-wise , but not visually . Plenty of nudity and lots of interesting little lectures by the two cousins turned vampire , one of whom sort of resembles Joey Ramone . That is , if Joey Ramone was a French vampire . I found this to be highly entertaining and definitely very weird , and it appealed to me a lot . Don't look for lots of continuity and a neat little story that gets neatly wrapped up though , this is a Jean Rollin film and that's not generally done , it seems . Very cool stuff . .
For once a movie that lives up to the hype on the box	In the mood for an Aussie horror-comedy that is a worthy successor to Peter Jackson's Dead Alive ? ( Yeah , I know he's from NZ ) . Then look no further ! This is a gory , goofy concoction from the Spierig brothers , whomever they may be , and it's clever , funny , creepy , and yes , bloody as hell . But it works VERY well . A meteorite shower , followed by strange craft in the air , spells trouble for the small town of Berkeley , and anyone getting nailed by the meteorites ( and there are quite a few , considering the square footage of the area in which they are falling ) gets up and starts doing the zombie thing . A group of survivors come across an old farmhouse ( sound familiar ? ) and take refuge with the man that lives there , Marion , a farmer & survivalist ( and former owner of Marion's House of Weapons ) . When one of the women that happens to be pregnant goes into labor they find themselves in need of getting to a hospital and off they go in an old van . The effects in this are fast and furious and yes , somewhat gruesome to say the least , but this is well done and if you're a Peter Jackson fan of say , Dead Alive or Bad Taste , you'll love this . The ending is on a rather serious note compared to the rest of the movie though , but it was fitting , in my mind . An awesomely good gore fest , with tons of excellent humor and outrageous stuff . , woo HOO ! !
In a word , FANTASTIC !	I had high hopes for this movie ever since I'd heard about it , and saw the previews not too long ago at another show and it looked great . For once the previews did not show all the best parts and leave me with filled with disappointment . Grindhouse is by far the best movie I've seen in years . It's hilarious , it's gory , it's disgusting , it's full of action and it grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go for about three freaking hours . The opening of the film is a " preview " for an upcoming attraction called " Machete " which had people laughing their heads off , featuring the ever-charming Danny Trejo , then into " Planet Terror " and it's one wild ride . The story has something to do with biological weapons and crazed zombies and of course , a bunch of survivors that are running from them , including go-go dancer Rose McGowan and the mysterious Wray . Plenty of wild action , crazed doctors , popping pustules , and poor Cherry ( McGowan ) loses a leg , and is first fitted with a wooden table leg prosthetic and then a machine gun . Plenty of black comedy going on in this one and buckets of blood , and even Wray riding a mini-motorbike suitable for a Shriner as he and the survivors ride into zombie territory . Absolutely stunning . Then , more previews of coming attractions , including " Werewolf Women of the SS " , " Don't " ( Don't look in the basement , don't go in the house , etc ) and the charming " Thanksgiving " , which had the audience laughing their heads off , and into " Death Proof " . While the opening of Death Proof is strong , it takes a bit of time to get going but once it does it never lets up . Kurt Russell plays Stunt Man Mike , a seemingly nice guy who gets his kicks causing car accidents in which young ladies are killed , and then he runs up against some stunt women who are crazier than he is and meets his match . Tracie Thoms , Rosario Dawson , and Zoe Bell are awesome as the crazed stunt women who take a 1970 Dodge Charger out on a test drive from which it will never return , and I haven't seen any trashy 70's movies that were this heart-in-mouth . Both features are presented with scratchy , grainy looking 70's style film-making , and yet they still have modern contrivances such as instant messaging , cell phones , etc . The look , the feel , and the atmosphere that's created is a wonder to behold , and it works quite well overall . The music is also great , and the " main theme " from " Planet Terror " is great . The style of music in " Death Proof " was actually more suited to a 70's type movie though , although no complaints about the music overall , it was fantastic . There are also bit parts by Tom Savini , Bruce Willis ( uncredited ) Udo Kier , Sheri Moon Zombie , and others , many in the " trailers " and there's almost too much here to absorb in one viewing . I'd say if you love 70's exploitation flicks and Rodriquez / Tarrantino / Eli Roth , and want a rollicking good time , go see this right now . Obviously the theater audience was highly appreciative and enjoyed this a lot , and for the first showing of this film on the first day , the theater was packed . , I can't say enough about how awesome this was .
A real feast	This is one of my favorite foreign films ever . Like " Brazil " it takes place in a " futuristic " society which looks like it takes place in the 40's . After a nuclear war a small band of people in a town survive by trading , scrounging , and eating each other . This has some absolutely wonderful performances by an excellent cast . This is a dark black comedy , which at times is whimsical , and at other times , somewhat gruesome , and sometimes both at the same time . An outsider comes to town and finds employment doing " odd jobs " for a butcher . He falls in love with the butcher's shy daughter . Little does he know that plans are being made for him that probably don't fit in with his intentions . This movie has so many little things that it must be watched more than once to catch them all . There is a sequence featuring a bicycle pump , knitting needles , a man and a woman in bed making love in a bed with squeaky springs , that is just incredibly entertaining . Another highlight is a depressed and suicidal woman who makes several unsuccessful attempts at doing herself in . And that's entertaining ? Yeah , it is , you have to SEE it . This is a totally bizarre film , equal parts light and dark , with very likeable characters and somewhat of a good nature to it despite its subject matter . Highly recommended , and if you see this and DO like it , you will want to see " City of Lost Children " and " Amelie " , which are both by the same people , also containing some of the same actors . !
