The living dead return . . . unfortunately	There are two mysteries surrounding this movie ; firstly , why was it ever made ? And secondly , why did I bother watching it ? The first can be somewhat explained by the fact that zombie flicks have enjoyed a new lease of life recently with films such as Shaun of the Dead and the terrible Dawn of the Dead remake being so successful ; but that doesn't explain how anyone could think that a third sequel to a decent eighties zombie comedy is needed . The second mystery is too easily explained away by the fact that I spend far too much time watching bad films . I can't really say it's a shame that this film is so terrible ; I mean , it's been over a decade since the last Return of the Living Dead films , and if it wasn't for the fact that Brian Yuzna's entry strayed so far off the series ' path ; that probably wouldn't have been the decent film that it is anyway . Judging on its own merits , the film doesn't get any better . The plot follows a bunch of kids who effortlessly hack into an evil corporation in the search for their friend Zeke who was injured in a motorcycle crash . It isn't long before they find out that research is being done into zombies . . . and it isn't long after that they're fending off the fiends themselves . . . The film has a very low quality feel throughout , and this is matched by the low quality plot , low quality script and low quality special effects . The zombies are nothing special , and the fact that some of them are slow and lumbering , while others can talk and fire guns just loses the film more credibility ; and this film isn't exactly well endowed where credibility is concerned . The cast is made up , as you might expect , by young kids . Horror films can barely be made without teenagers these days ; and this one is no different . The action where the zombies are concerned is very unimaginative , and it seems that whoever wrote the screenplay figured the way to a good film is to throw in a punch or explosion every few minutes to keep the audience interested . Needless to say , that guy was wrong . The sets are about as noteworthy as the rest of the film , and on the whole ; even if you're a die hard Return of the Living Dead fan , this film should be avoided like you'd avoid an actual zombie outbreak . The only scene I'm going to remember by the time next week comes is the one where an unlucky tramp is eaten by his dinner . And I doubt I'll remember that in a fortnight .
Boring combination of war flick and zombie movie .	A general rule of thumb when it comes to movies is : if it involves Nazi's , don't watch it . From the crappy Nazisploitation genre that was unjustly popular in the seventies to ' Nazi zombie ' movies like Shock Waves and Zombie Lake , there's rarely anything good that involves Nazi's - and " Horrors of War " not only does nothing to buck that trend , but is actually worse than most of the other Nazi crap that I've seen . The film features a World War 2 setting and focuses on the popular myth about Hitler having an interest in the supernatural and trying to incorporate it into his army . Basically , we end up with a bunch of soldiers ' researching ' Hitler's new weapons . The main problem with this film is that it's boring . All the characters are basically the same ( and all portrayed in the same , downbeat , way ) and therefore are impossible to care about . The plot formula features the soldiers sitting around talking to each other , walking around , and every now and then happening upon a zombie soldier which they kill , and then sit around and talk about it . The film was obviously shot on a very low budget as it all looks very cheaply done . This also extends to the zombie make-up too , which is rubbish . I am surprised that I actually sat down for ninety minutes watching this piffle . Naturally , I don't recommend that anyone else does so .
Terrible exploitation garbage	Well , I actually thought that this film would be about zombies , but instead the lacklustre plot follows a deranged young man who keeps women locked up in his barn in order to use them for some kind of circus trick . The film is yet another entry in the already full to the brim seventies exploitation cannon , and while a lot of these sorts of films are very good - this one has very little going for it . The film is , frankly , boring , and since the plot has very little in the way of originality ; this film makes for very miserable viewing because you know that nothing is going to come of it . There's another sub-plot involving the young man's father who has been mutated by radiation . This is potentially interesting , but it's not handled well at all and not even that manages to change the tedium of the rest of the film . The acting is horrible as well , and director Alan Rudolph isn't able to get anything out of his cast . Films like this really need to be rather ' nasty ' to succeed , and that's one of the most annoying things about this film ; it all feels very tame , and therefore its pointless watching . Overall , Barn of the Naked Dead is a film that fully deserves its terrible reputation , and I recommend not watching it .
The radio was only playing rubbish on the set of this stinker	You know those really stupid ideas you get sometimes when you wake up in the middle of the night ? Well , you can imagine the scene : the man who would later have the idea for Destiny Turns on the Radio is asleep in his bed . He wakes up in a cold sweat one night ; " A magic swimming pool ! " , he exclaims , " . . and a cool guy can come out , and this guy be the illusive one , who holds it all together " , he's really sweating now , " and we'll get Quentin Tarantino to play him ! " . After seeing the movie , it's safe to say that it was a extremely stupid idea . As mentioned , Quentin Tarantino plays a man that comes out a swimming pool . Yes , you heard me right ; in an absolutely ridiculous sequence , Tarantino actually rises from an electricity-ridden swimming pool . The only thing more ridiculous than that sequence in this movie is Quentin Tarantino's actual performance . Tarantino has proved , time and time again , that acting isn't his forte , but he puts it beyond a shadow of a doubt here . He tries to look cool with his swagger and slow moving voice , but he actually just looks pathetic . One good thing is that he doesn't get a lot of screen time ; but the mere fact that he's in it loses the movie some of it's credibility , and this is a movie that doesn't exactly have credibility to burn . It's a shame that this movie is so terrible really , as it does have quite a good cast . Dylan McDermott , one of stars of my guiltiest pleasure , 1999's rom-com ; Three to Tango takes the lead role , with Nancy Travis ( So I Married an Axe Murderer ) as his girlfriend , James LeGros as his friend and David Cross , who I actually like a lot , is in the movie as an agent of some sort . The stupid plot isn't helped at all by a lacklustre script . Modern crime movies have become known for snappy dialogue and offbeat characters , and this movie has both ; albeit both badly done . The dialogue has some truly ridiculous lines and most of the time they are delivered badly , too . This is most probably due to the fact that most of the cast were probably cursing their agents while making this film , and have probably spent the last ten years trying to forget that Destiny ever turned on the radio . As you , the viewer , will no doubt do ; but it certainly won't take ten years . My advice ? Watch something else .
A boring and poorly made Italian oddity	Well , I'm a massive fan of Italian horror ; particularly Giallo and Gothic horror , so I was looking forward to this given that it's meant to be a sort of cross-over between the two . However , my hopes were dashed as Something is Creeping in the Dark is one boring and poorly made film ! I spent an hour and a half watching this film , and yet I really have very little to say about it . The plot is wafer thin and simply focuses on the idea of a bunch of strangers being holed up in a spooky old house for the night . However , they're not the only ones there are some ghostly presence is there too ! That's it really . The attempts to build up the characters and their relationships all fall flat , and all that is left to admire is the atmosphere ; which isn't exactly anything to write home about as it's a carbon copy of the atmosphere in any number of similar films and director Mario Colucci fails to bring anything new to the table . The film was obviously made on a low budget and there certainly is worse films out there - but I seriously can see no reason to bother tracking this oddity down as there's many , many better films out there too !
Doesn't even come close to doing James Herbert's book justice .	Some of the best films of all time have been literary adaptations ; but this adaptation of James Herbert's novel , ' Haunted ' , isn't one of them . James Herbert is one of my favourite writers , and although ( and I'm sure my fellow Herbert fans will agree with me ) Haunted isn't the man's best work - it surely deserves much better handling than this . This adaptation isn't even faithful to the original novel ! The characters have the same names , and most plot points are intact - but a lot of things , including important elements such as the persona of the lead character , and the ending have been changed entirely - meaning this isn't really an adaptation of Herbert's novel , it's merely a film that uses the same character names as the book , and a similar setting . The plot follows cynical parapsychologist David Ash when he is asked to investigate at a spooky old mansion . The inhabitants include the ( probably ) insane Nanny Tess , and the three siblings ; Simon , Robert and Christina . It isn't long before David realises that there's something strange about this family . . . Something I really can't understand about this film is simply WHY they deviated from the book ? There's nothing in the book that isn't film-able , and although most of what has been changed isn't all that important , many things ; such as the fact that in the book , the old house doesn't have a phone , meaning David had to walk to the local phone box just increases the isolation and makes the whole piece more frightening . The way that the ending has been changed is truly unforgivable , as the climax to the novel is the thing that really makes the story what it is . Up until the climax , Haunted is pretty much just another ghost story ( albeit a good one ) ; but the ending is where Herbert gets to show his imagination - yet this film has gone and changed it , leaving the ending as little more than another climax to another ghost film . There isn't big black dog in this film either ! The cast , however , is fairly decent ; with Aidan Quinn not convincing me much at first , but he gets better as it progresses . Kate Beckinsale stands out the most , as the beautiful Christina Mariell . Overall , all that's happened here is that director Lewis Gilbert has changed a good horror novel into a very superfluous movie . My advice is simple - read the book , forget the movie .
A sequel most foul !	Introducing one of the most redundant sequels ever made ! I have to say , when I first heard that Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece ' The Birds ' had a made for TV sequel , I didn't quite believe it - but unfortunately , it turns out that it is true , and it's every bit as bad you would expect it to be . Gone is the gripping tension filled atmosphere of the original , and in its place is a whole host of terrible cringe-worthy performance , some atrocious dialogue and a plot that , while essentially the same as the one featured in the original film , isn't even a fraction as interesting second time round . The plot focuses on a family which comprises a mother , a father , a dog and two irritating daughters . They've decided to retreat to retreat to Lands End , which will enable him to write an important biology thesis , and for the family to get over the death of their son . However , they soon discover that Land's End isn't the serene paradise they thought it would be - as the local flocks of birds have once again , for some unknown reason , decided to begin attacking the people that live there . The oddest thing about this film is the fact that Tippi Hedren is in it . She must have really needed the money , as taking a role in this film is certainly an ill-advised career move . When the director's credit goes to the anonymous Alan Smithee , you can't count on good direction - and I certainly don't blame Rick Rosenthal ( Halloween 2 ) for disowning this film . The majority of The Birds II concerns the audience cringing while the untalented stars reel off line after line of excruciating dialogue . None of the cast outside Hedren manage anything resembling a memorable performance - and if it wasn't for The Birds star's performance in the first film , she wouldn't either . Quite why she takes an entirely unrelated role is anyone's guess , but at least that fact makes The Birds II slightly less of a blemish on Hitchcock's original . There's a fair bit of violence , but none of it is very interesting and overall , I'm still not sure why I watched this film . Maybe curiosity , maybe just for completion purposes . . . who knows ? But I would recommend simply watching the original again rather than watching this .
Packs about as much bark as a goldfish	Hey , don't you think it's kind of odd that someone would stab themselves in the chest with a flick knife and then bury themselves ? If your answer to the above question is " I agree " , then you could have been , or may well be part of the team of monkeys that came up with the idea for , wrote and cast this movie . It's a huge shame that stuff like this gets made when there are screenwriters and directors with good ideas and just need some money . Speaking of money , if you want to waste it ; Bones is as good a film as any to waste it on . Well , if you like to waste money and you enjoy pain , that is . Bones is notable for one of the most incredible reasons a film can be notable for , and that is that it stars a rapper . The rapper in question is Snoop Dogg ( a . k . a . Dogg , Snoopy , Snoop Doggy Dogg , Snoop and just about every other lame variant of the words ' snoop ' and ' dogg ' that you can come up with ) . The tired blend of Hellraiser and rubbish movie starring a rapper see Snoop Dogg get to flex his acting muscles , and he proves with his one-note performance in this movie that he is just as adept at the art of acting as he is at the art of music making . If you catch my drift . To be quite frank , despite his best efforts to look cool ; Snoopy Doggy Dogg ends up looking like just as much of an idiot as his name suggests he is . I mean seriously , who goes by the name of ' Snoop Dogg ' when they don't have to ? Aside from it's star , this film has a number of other problems . It's plot is very tired , and it follows the exceedingly boring and familiar tale of someone who was killed being resurrected and then taking their revenge . The tacky dialogue , duff acting and illogical plotting don't help this , and not even the murders can save the film , as it's easy to say that even they manage to score maximum points on the dull scale . I will never forgive the people responsible for this movie for wasting all that time and money on it , when it could have been put to better use . How about giving one of the more experienced directors who could produce something good , if given a budget ? I guess that's one of the many problems with things like rap music ; if it sells , it will continue to be made .
Yet another pointless remake	Like most of the horror loving community , the news that British classic The Omen was to suffer an Americanised remake wasn't welcome , but I figured I'd give it a fair chance anyway . As usual with remakes , I now wish I hadn't as all this film does is remind me of how good the original is . Indeed , there is nothing that the remake has over the original and all it is offers is a tired retelling of a very good story . The plot hasn't been changed , but the film does offer some new ideas , all of which are misplaced and don't work well - bringing the two towers into it being a case in point . Anyway , the plot focuses on Robert Thorn , the British ambassador and a man who unwittingly takes on the Devil's child after his own died at birth . A few odd events later and Thorn becomes convinced by various parties that Damien is the devil's spawn and so sets off to get some daggers to kill him with . The cast is one of the most annoying things about this remake . Liev Schreiber is a poor successor to the brilliant Gregory Peck , while the likes of Julia Stiles , Mia Farrow Michael Gambon and Pete Postlethwaite all fail to impress in their respective roles . The kid that they've got to play Damien isn't menacing at all , and this is a huge dent in the film as this is an important role that the audience must believe is the root of all evil . The film has none of the atmosphere of the original , and the glossy cinematography does the plot line no favours . The over the top death scenes were a big part of the 1976 classic , but here they suffer from the same problem as the rest of the film - that being the fact that they're well known now and so don't have the power that they did in the original . A lot of the people that see this won't have seen the original , but for those of us that have watching this remake is an excruciating waste of time . The original Omen received a couple of pretty terrible sequels , but not one of them ( not even Omen IV ) are even half as bad as this crappy effort . Overall , I can't recommend this film to anyone - fans of the original will hate it for not living up to the standard , and those that haven't seen the original will hate it because it's just so poor . Don't bother , is my advice to everyone .
Messy Jean Rollin vampire flick	French director Jean Rollin isn't exactly known for great films , and this confusing mess is one of the reasons why . One of the most confusing things about this production is the title . For a director who is well known for directing erotic films about lesbian vampires ; you would expect a film with the word ' nude ' in the title to be a particularly bare-breasted one ; but in fact , there's not a lot of nudity here at all . Instead of erotic lesbian vampires with no clothes on ; we've got a cumbersome plot about a man who wants to unlock the secret to immortality , a young woman whose affliction might hold the key and a suicide cult , who don't get to do much . The film starts off promisingly with a sequence that sees a young girl carried off by a mysterious bunch of people in masks under the watchful eye of a young French man , who also happens to be the son of a man of importance . Through his investigation , he soon discovers that this woman is not just a normal lady , and as he delves deeper into the cult ; he discovers that cannot be killed by bullets , drinks blood and can't go out in daylight . . . sounds like a clear cut case of vampirism to me . Jean Rollin keeps the fantasy atmosphere going throughout the film , but it fails to be interesting because the plot is so badly executed . It is possible to keep up with what's going on , but only because there's so many other films that follow similar plots to this one . The director seems to know that he's messed up the plotting too , as the climax is basically an excuse to explain the film to the audience . There is a twist thrown in at the end also ; but the film would have been better without it . I guess this was Jean Rollin's attempt to be a little original , but it comes off as a ham-fisted attempt at such , rather than a logical continuation of the story . The cinematography is fairly neat , with lots of the plot taking place in suitably Gothic locations . The girls on board complete what is a pretty picture , and what Rollin's film lacks in logic and consistency , it somewhat makes up for in style . In the film's defence , it was made in 1969 ; which somewhat explains the lack of shocks but I can't recommend this movie as it doesn't have much about it that is worth taking note of .
Obscure and lacklustre thriller	Despite hearing nothing but bad things about it , I actually went into If Looks Could Kill with some expectations as I really liked the sound of the plot description . In terms of entertainment value , I often find that you cant go wrong with a trashy thriller ; but this one is shabbily made even by genre standards and even more unforgivable than that is the fact that it's really rather boring . The plot should have given the film a great base for an entertaining thrill ride and focuses on a photographer who is asked to film a woman . Naturally , this seedy request turns out to be a bit less than kosher and soon the photographer discovers that he's been set up to take a murder wrap when the girl's dead body turns up . The film does have a gritty and seedy atmosphere which is to its credit as it helps the fetid atmosphere but the film is not a fun watch owing to the fact that the plot isn't made best use of and it's really rather ugly . Director Chuck Vincent's filmography is mostly made up of porn titles so it's not really surprising that If Looks Could Kill is unprofessionally done . This film is very obscure and hard to find and I'm sure that it will stay that way as there's no real need to track it down . Feel free to skip this one !
Mostly unsuccessful Italian thriller	I can only imagine that Death Rage was meant as some sort of cash in on the success of Yul Brynner's earlier movies because as a film in its own right , it really is severely lacking . This is actually quite a surprise too as it's directed by Antonio Margheriti who , while certainly in the ' B ' category of Italian directors active in the seventies , still made some very good films with the likes of Schoolgirl Killer and Danse Macabre . This , however , is not one of his finer hours . The plot is just your average everyday story of a hit-man looking for revenge on someone that he is close to ; in this case , it's the death of his brother and on the way to his revenge he falls in love with a stripper played by Barbara Bouchet . Yul Brynner often gets the " hard man " act spot on ; but personally I find him to be uncharismatic and I can't really say I'm a fan . The main reason I saw this film is because of the inclusion of the beautiful Barbara Bouchet ; but unfortunately for me ( and the rest of the red blooded male audience ) she is sadly underused . There's a fair bit of action in the film , but to be honest I couldn't really care about it as the plot line is so boring . The film hasn't exactly won itself a good reputation in the thirty years since it was made and I'm not surprised about that . I can't really say there's any good reason to see this film .
Porn nonsense from one of the sleaze masters	Ah , Italy . Back in the seventies ; if a certain type of film was successful , those crazy Italians would make their own version of it . The French Emmanuelle series must have been pretty popular , as it didn't take them long to knock a ' m ' out of the title and create their own version . This is my first Emanuelle film ( Italian or otherwise ) , and I'm not in a rush to see any more . If I had to describe this film in one word , I would use the word ' hollow ' . There is absolutely no substance , and no point , to Emanuelle in America ; not even a backhanded comment on ' sex in the media ' or something , and all the film really is , is a series of sex scenes dumped in between sections of irrelevance , which appear to be some attempt at forming a plot . Laura Gemser takes the lead role , as a woman who isn't too fussy when it comes to having sex . Tall , short ; fat , thin ; man , woman ; smoker , non-smoker - ten fingers or twelve - you'd have a chance with this woman . The first scene sets the right tone for the rest of the movie nicely ; we see a man about to kill Emanuelle in her own car . This sequence is silly , badly scripted , completely irrelevant and nothing comes of it - just like the rest of the movie . The film plays to its strengths , however ; and the fact that Laura Gemser stars in pretty much every scene shows this . I don't profess to be big fan myself , but I understand she has quite a cult following ; which has no doubt won this flick most of its fans . As you'd expect , sex sequences are in abundance ; which is sure to please most viewers as that'll be what most people are tuning in for . I , however , can't say I'm a massive fan of porn films . The sex here is never overly erotic anyway , and it's really easy to get bored as the plot is so non-existent . Joe D'Amato's name is synonymous with sleaze , and this film shows that nicely . Considering the type of film this is ( and the country it was made in ) , the production values here are surprisingly good ! The film is well photographed , while the locations are generally fairly lavish and colourful . The music fits nicely , and the way in which certain sex scenes take place - such as the one in front of an orchestra - show some imagination on the director's part . I can't say I enjoyed this film too much ; it has its moments , but one hundred minutes is too long for this sort of thing , and I reckon that unless you're a fan of films where people walk round talking nonsense while they're not screwing each other ; this one is best forgotten .
I wish I'd Look ( er ) ed somewhere else	Thinking about it , I'm not a very big fan of Michael Crichton . Westworld is a good film , but Coma was disappointing ; and this film , Looker , isn't up to much at all . The early scenes and music indicate that the film is going to be another trashy eighties thriller , which is fine by me ; but suddenly the film slows down to snail pace , and despite a few nice murder sequences early on ; there really isn't much to remember Looker for . For this film , Crichton has took ideas from the worlds of plastic surgery and advertising , and attempted to blend them into a horror / thriller . To say he wasn't successful would be an understatement , as the plot requires a huge stretch of the imagination and the murders that happen early on never get anything in the way of an explanation . The film focuses on an eminent Beverley Hills plastic surgeon named Larry Roberts . After performing slight surgery on a number of almost perfect young women , he is surprised to find them turn up dead . After doing a bit of research , he stumbles on an advertising company called Digital Matrix , who have their own uses for ' perfect ' women . Given that this is an early eighties film , you've got to expect some tacky visuals and an even tackier soundtrack ; but the film takes these elements and then delivers a story that is far too serious in tone , and it doesn't bode well at all . Furthermore , Crichton's plotting is awful as the film quickly becomes boring when the writer-director starts forgetting to explain things properly . You can't fault him for imagination , as plastic surgery usually leads to an interesting film , and there's no end of social commentary that can be sprung from the world of advertising ; but in failing to capitalise on the story's strong elements , Crichton has made what could have been a masterpiece into a dull and boring film . The acting isn't bad , but again ; nothing to write home about . Albert Finney is good in the lead role , and he receives welcome feedback from the likes of James Coburn and Susan Dey . The film isn't all bad ( just mostly ) , and there are a few memorable sequences ; most notably a young girl falling several stories onto a car roof , and a scene at a dinner table towards the end ; but I'm really surprised that this is given praise as an " unsung movie " - it certainly doesn't deserve it !
Too complex for it's own good with a silly twist - thank god for the gore !	Well , shallow Ground delivers a fairly original take on a very mundane horror film idea ; but unfortunately , it doesn't come off that well as the plot is delivered in a very confusing way and as the film isn't all that interesting - working out exactly what's going becomes more of a chore than anything else . Director Sheldon Wilson obviously appreciates atmosphere , which is a good thing and the film also looks rather nice . The story takes place around a police station near to a dam . This provides a decent setting as much of the surroundings is made up of woodland area , which gives Shallow Ground a backwoods slasher sort of feel . The film kicks off properly when a naked , knife-wielding kid who just happens to be covered in blood arrives at the station . The cops handcuff him to a chair , and then we get shown what happened to the chief's girlfriend one year previously . Naturally , the coppers want to know who the boy is and where he came from ; and the investigation leads the chief to confront ' his own personal demons ' ( blah blah ) . Shallow Ground is something of a weird horror film , as its style is that of a dull ghost story - but it's also really quite gory by modern standards ! The gore is definitely what saves it as if it wasn't for the buckets of blood , this film would have been too torturous to bear . There's not a great deal of ' stand out ' gore scenes , however ; the one towards the end which goes on for ages is the only real memorable part of the movie . The cast isn't anything to write home about , but I was excited to see Patricia " The Bad Seed " McCormack on the cast list , as I haven't seen her in anything since the 1956 horror classic . Her performance here is something of a disappointment , however , as she fails to make an impression along with the rest of the performers . The influence of the buffoon M Night Shyamalan can certainly be seen on this film , as the director sees fit to chuck in a completely absurd twist to go along with the questionable plot . The final climax doesn't make any sense at all , and leads me to think it's there just to add ' ambiguity ' , or because Sheldon Wilson hoped to get a budget for a sequel . I hope he doesn't get it .
A huge Hammer misfire	Over the years , Hammer studios have provided us with some true classics within the horror genre . However , if this is the only Hammer film you've ever seen , then you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise . All the things that make Hammer horror great are absent from this movie ; it lacks charm , originality and it isn't intelligent or imaginative . It's a shame too , because the plot isn't a bad one . It involves a satanic cult that is posing as a Christian church and has chosen a child to ' become the devil ' upon her eighteenth birthday . However , now that time has come and her father has decided that he wants to back out of the deal , only the cult isn't going to let him . So , as you can see , we have devil worshippers , sacrifice , Christopher Lee as the head of the cult , the devil himself even makes an appearance . . . this is great horror stuff , and if it had the right handling , it might have been able to capitalise on it's premise ; but as it happens , it did not . The main reason it fails is that it's just so DULL . The film takes ages to get anywhere , and by the time something does happen , you don't care because you're so bored . Speaking of being bored , Christopher Lee doesn't exactly approach his role in this film with gusto and his performance , although still malevolent as Lee always is , pretty much is the epitome of this film ; bored . As usual with Hammer , the production values are low ; but usually it doesn't matter as you can forgive the film for it , and even like it , depending on the film ; but here , since the rest of the film is so bad ; it's hard to forgive the bad production values . When the devil does appear , it's so ridiculous that all you will be able to do is laugh . I never thought I'd see the devil as a glove puppet ! There are no real standout moments in this film , and even the ending isn't any good . I was expecting it to at least end with a bang after making us sit through nearly ninety minutes of boredom , but no . I recommend this film to people that want to see every Hammer Horror movie ever made . Everyone else should avoid like the plague .
Walken is back ! . . . in a rather mundane sequel	The first Prophecy wasn't a bad film , but whether or not it deserved a sequel is debatable . So far , it has actually received four sequels - but this is the only one that I've seen . Overall , this film isn't good enough to warrant me bothering with any more follow-ups , but it provides a decent enough hour and twenty minutes of entertainment . Just like the original , this film fuses action with themes of biblical horror and once again follows the fortunes of the diabolical angel Gabriel during another plot to destroy the human race . Naturally , it's all very convoluted and silly ; doesn't make much sense and features several elements that are obviously thrown in to sell the film ; but hey , you can't expect anything else from a film like this . The film revolves around a child conceived by Gabriel's adversary , Danyael and a normal woman . Gabriel has taken it upon himself to get rid of this baby , which was prophesised by a monk ; and after his army of angels have been exterminated , he decides to employ the services of a suicidal girl named ' Izzy ' . . . The main reason I saw this film was , of course , because of the presence of its lead star ; Christopher Walken . Walken's role isn't very meaty , but he makes the best of it with a charged performance that steals every scene he's in . The original film benefited from a great star-studded cast to support Walken ; whereas this film doesn't . That being said , it does feature some decent actors . Jennifer Beals is good in support along with Russell Wong , while future star Brittany Murphy stands out as the suicide obsessed teen and cult horror fans will recognise Re-Animator's Bruce Abbott in a small role . The film features a plethora of action scenes , which are mostly well done ; but after a while it all gets rather dry as the plot isn't too interesting and it all seems to drone on . The film doesn't really fit much with any actual bible stories ; which is something of a disappointment as that was one of the best things about the original movie . Overall , Prophecy II is worth seeing for fans of the original , although it's not a particularly good movie .
A silly waste of film stock	The 1980's were a breeding ground for this sort of horror film - cheap , tacky and devoid of anything even resembling a point or an intellect . However , many of these films are fun , easy viewing and although they aren't exceptional in any way , they're a nice waste of time . The Nest is a film that fits that bill pretty cleanly . The plot ( or lack thereof ) follows an evil corporation that has engineered a new species of Super-Roach ? to wipe out the bog-standard ordinary cockroaches . Naturally , something goes wrong and these new Super-Roaches ? want a more varied diet than their fellow bug and so decide to start eating flesh instead . Oh dear . However , it gets better as these bugs aren't just ordinary bugs that happen to eat flesh , they also have the ability to merge with their subjects , which leads to lots of different hybrids of bug , including dog-bugs and , best of all , a human bug hybrid ; which features in one of the most hilarious special effect sequences of the entire 1980's . Make no mistake , this film is rubbish . The acting in particular is terrible , with Robert Lansing providing the heroics and , well , he's no Arnold Schwarzenegger , let's put it that way . Most of the cast are miscast , but one highlight of casting is Stephen Davies , in the role of the over the top bug hunter . Bad films often try and cover up their crappyness with silly characters , and The Nest is no exception . The glaring casting mistake is Terri Treas , who plays the scientist who becomes obsessed with studying the new type of insect . Treas would have been believable as a gardener , or a hairdresser or even the woman on one of those irritating shopping channels - but not a scientist . I know it's just 80's kitsch , but come on ! As mentioned , the effects in the film aren't bad . They're not very realistic ( but how could they be ? ) , but they're gory and get the job done . One problem with the film , though , is that it gets boring on too many occasions and you will no doubt find yourself just waiting out the talking scenes until the next part with gore comes on . Still , if you're after daft horror , you could do worse .
Some good ideas , but dull plotting spoils it	Well , after reading all the good reviews ; some of which coming from reviewers that I often agree with , I was really looking forward to seeing The Nameless . After having sat down and watched it , however , I'm really disappointed . The film is not really ' bad ' , but it's not very good either and that's a shame considering that the film clearly so much wanted to be a great thriller . The plot is not very original , though that isn't the film's main problem . Many recycled plots have sprung great movies ; the main problem here is that the plot moves too slowly and it's never interesting enough to remain thrilling for the duration . The film does have a few nice ideas , though . The Nameless starts with an editor named Claudia , who goes to identify the mutilated body of her dead daughter . The body has had every trace of its identity removed and can only be identified by a bracelet and the fact that one leg was slightly shorter than the other . Five years later , however , Claudia receives a call . . . from her daughter , who is begging her mother to save her . Director Jaume Balagueró , who later went on to make the even more disappointing horror thriller ' Darkness ' does manage to create a nice atmosphere for the film . Everything looks slightly grey , which makes it depressing and in turn serves the film well . I would guess that the film's main influence was David Fincher's hit ' Seven ' as the two are very similar in tone . The film was made in Spain , and that is also disappointing . Spain , along with Italy , made some of the very best thrillers in the seventies , but the recent output of this genre from both countries has been disappointing - the Italian ' Occhi Di Cristallo ' is another example of this . The recent films have lost what made them great previously , presumably because they're attempting to copy recent American films . The plot sort of drones on for the first eighty minutes as the dull characters uncover various facts and clues , and finally the film becomes interesting in the last ten minutes - though by this time , of course , it's already too late . The film was based on a good idea and it does have a few nice moments ; but overall I would have to rate this as not much more than an interesting failure .
Vampires have never been so boring . . .	Martin Kemp is probably best known , acting wise , for his role in gangster flick The Krays , and British soap opera Eastenders , and that is a fact that he should be thankful for ; as no one would like to be remembered for a film like this . Embrace of the Vampire is a non-event of massive proportions , as the unoriginal premise is never capitalised upon , and it's all bolstered by a host of inept performances . Martin Kemp is particularly awful as ' The Vampire ' . He tries and tries to look sexy and foreboding , but succeeds only in looking silly as his accent is appalling and he's about as sexy as Pat Butcher and Pauline Fowler in a wet T-Shirt competition . The film takes obvious influence from Dracula , and follows Kemp's vampire as we see him become the undead and try desperately to find the woman he loved while he was human . Around the same time , Catholic girl Charlotte begins having dreams of the vampire , and it's not long before he's trying to will her to him in order for the pair to spend their eternal lives together . The film is famous mostly for its female lead and her lovely breasts . Alyssa Milano is Embrace of the Vampire's only positive element , and were it not for her ; this film would really be the pits . I'm sure Milano will be most people's reason for watching - me included - and it's definitely a good thing that the film puts a lot of its focus on sex . The sex scenes are soft-core at best , and unfortunately they're not very erotic . It is a shame that Martin Kemp was cast in the lead as had a better actor have taken his place , the film could have been passable . . . the man really doesn't know how to play an enticing role . There's a few scenes of gore , but the film is never very nasty and while some of them are well shot , they're again poorly acted and not really worth seeing . The plot is very thinly spread , and the film definitely needed a lot more ' bite ' . It all boils down to an ending typical of the rest of the film , as rather than coming to a head in an exciting and interesting way ; it just peters out . Overall , Embrace of the Vampire is merely a kick in the teeth and definitely doesn't come recommended .
Lacking , even for this sort of movie	One sub-genre that was popular in the decade of kitsch ; the 1980's , was teen comedy . This is a good or a bad thing depending on which side of the fence you're on , but whatever side ; this isn't a particularly good example . As a big hater of Animal House , me writing this review begs the question " why did you bother ? " The answer to that is probably because I liked the title . It has a fun ring to it , and I reckoned that a title like that should spawn a good film . While the film isn't essentially ' bad ' , it does have a strong scent of deja vu following it around , and while I aren't a guru on the subject of teen comedies ; even I have seen the stuff in this movie before . It's got all the clichés , from all the kids getting stoned to the geeky kid getting off with the hottest babe in the school . The plot , as you might expect , is paper thin ; and it follows the story of a couple of nerds that move to a new college and immediately find themselves at the mercy of a fraternity of football ' jocks ' , who see fit to tease the nerds because they're nerds . This film came to my attention after the nerdy character in American Splendor gave it such high praise . From the way he described it , I was expecting something in the way of intelligence and maybe even characters that you can identify with . I don't know , maybe real life nerds who went to college in America will find the events of this film similar to events in real life and will therefore find this uplifting or whatever , but for a non-American schooled , non-nerd ; there isn't all that much to like . Some of the jokes are funny , such as the ' cool ' nerd's poker skills against a less savvy player , but many of them are silly in a not-very-good way . Younger audiences will almost certainly enjoy the nudity that the film features , along with some of the more childish jokes ; but for the serious cinema buffs amongst us ( me included ) , this is lacking even for an 80's teen comedy .
Well made , but disappointing thriller	" Pins you to the edge of your seat " is the tagline for this film , and while that could be aptly applied to many thrillers ; it certainly doesn't suit this one ! John Hough's Eyewitness has the basis for a decent story ( even if it's not all that original ) but it's never capitalised on properly and , for the first two thirds at least , the film is slow , largely uninteresting and lacks tension and suspense ; thus not providing what you want or expect from a film that calls itself thriller ( much less , one that proudly proclaims that you will be on the edge of your seat ) . The plot takes obvious influence from the common thriller idea of having somebody witness a crime and then having the perpetrators go after that person ; here , we also have a bit of ' the boy who cried wolf ' thrown in too for good measure . The eyewitness of the title is a boy named Ziggy who goes to watch a parade and ends up witnessing an assassination . It's not long before the assassins are on his tail , but naturally considering the boy's track record for lying , his family don't believe him . . . The film is rather well produced ; it looks nice , is well directed and mostly features good acting from the ensemble cast . Lionel Jeffries is my pick of the performers and he does well as the eccentric grandfather and head of the family . He gets good support from Tony Bonner as a young stranger who ends up with the family due to a care few and the beautiful Susan George as his granddaughter . The film also features a performance from Mark Lester and this is where the film falls down . The child actor will always be famous for his role as Oliver Twist in the 1968 film ( I'm not a fan ) , but here he is completely irritating and doesn't do much than run around looking scared for the ninety minute duration . The first two thirds of the film are very slow and dull and that's a shame because the film really opens in the final half hour and is actually quite good ; but by then I was too bored to care as much as I could have done were it not for the disappointing opening . The climax to the film is quite good and on the whole , while I wouldn't say this is a bad film ; it's not a particularly good one either .
Bizarre and atmospheric lesbian flick	It might have its problems , but at the very least , The Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay is memorable for the fact that it's so damn strange ! Director Bruno Gantillon succeeds in creating a surreal , dreamlike atmosphere ; which bodes very well with the fantasy styled plot . As the title suggests , the backbone of this film revolves around sex and since most of the characters are female , that should please fans of lesbian porn . The plot itself is typically strange and focuses on a castle ran by the mysterious and sinister Morgana le Fay . Two young ladies are travelling across the country when they get a surprise one morning . One of them awakes to find that the other has disappeared , and upon searching for her friend , she happens upon a boat . The boat takes her to an eerie castle where she meets Morgana le Fay and is taken in by the women in the castle . She is offered immortality in return for her soul , but as jealousies take hold she decides to make an attempt to escape , but getting away from Morgana le Fay is not so easy . . . One of the main problems I had with this film is the fact that not a great deal happens , so it's easy to get bored with it ; the dream-like atmosphere is actually a hindrance in this respect as when you're watching a dreamy , boring movie - it can sometimes be difficult to stay awake ! To its credit , The Girl Slaves of Morgana Le Fay is a very beautiful movie . There's no shortage of eye candy , all the women in the film look great and the lavish sets are well designed and suit the film . I can't say that it's a particularly graphic film , though that isn't a big problem . The lesbian sequences are well filmed and fairly erotic , which of benefit to the film . The film is a lot like the lesbian vampire flicks that cult French director Jean Rollin made around the same time that this film was made ; although personally I'd rank this one higher than the majority of Jean Rollin rubbish that I've seen . This is not a great film and it does have its fair share of problems , but it also has a lot of good things about it , and while I can't say it's a film that everyone should see ; it should please genre fans at least .
Marginally successful haunted house TV flick	Considering it's both a TV movie and a haunted house movie , it has to be said that This House Possessed really is rather good ; although only on its own terms . The plot follows the story of a burnt out writer and singer of awful pop songs as he moves into a modern computerised house with his live-in nurse and later girlfriend . It's not long before strange things start happening in the house and the nurse comes to believe she may have some connection with it . One problem this film has is the plotting ; the first half of the movie is basically a soap opera and while it's not especially uninteresting ; it's not really what I tuned in for and it takes a while for the movie to finally get going . The first half of the film does , however , set the characters up , which benefits the film well later on . Naturally , owing to the fact that this is a TV movie , there's no gore and little violence ; but there's a few death scenes and most of them are pretty decent . It all boils down to a twist that is made so obvious that I'm not really sure if it's actually supposed to be a twist at all . The idea of the house taking ' revenge ' on it's inhabitants is hardly original and even the computer idea had been done previously in ' Demon Seed ' , but the film generally plays on it's central ideas well and it is at least an interesting film . The film has apparently become quite rare and I wouldn't say it's worth a lot of trouble to track down but if you can find a copy , it is at least worth a look .
Ivan Rassimov dances with savages in Umberto Lenzi's kick-start to the cannibal sub-genre !	Umberto Lenzi was a diverse director , having made Giallo films , Italian crime films and some of the most notorious cannibal flicks , not to mention a whole host of other films with various sub-genres of horror . Deep River Savages is the film that is often given credit for kicking off the whole cannibal tradition , and it's also a member of the British ' Video Nasty ' list , which lead to it's banning in the eighties . It's odd that this film should be on that list ; however , as it's debatable as to whether or not it's even a horror film . Sure , it features some gore ; but this is more like an early version of Dances with Wolves than its more bloodthirsty cannibal film cousins . The film follows Ivan Rassimov ; a man who , after accidentally killing another man in a bar , finds himself in the Amazon jungle , where he is taken captive by a bunch of savages . After enduring various tortures , he finds himself the object of affection for a dim-witted female member of the tribe , and when she chooses him as her husband ; he soon realises that despite being bloodthirsty savages ; these guys aren't all that bad . . . Ivan Rassimov is one of my favourite cult Italian actors , and he does well in this film as his rugged appearance fits the feel of the movie very well and this makes him believable in the lead role . His performance gives the film credibility ; something which is lacking in a lot of these types of films . He is joined by his Last Cannibal World and Eaten Alive co-star Me Me Lai , whose appearance again helps the movie and the pair do actually bode quite well on screen together . Umberto Lenzi's direction is assured as usual , and he does a good job of ensuring that the location fits the tone of the movie at all times . The jungle setting is well realised , and the shots the savages ' village look great . The film is , like Kevin Coaster's highly rated nineties film , more than a little bit cheesy ; and this isn't helped by Ivan Rassimov's voice-over . If it wasn't for the fact that I've seen 1957's ' Run of the Arrow ' , I would imply that Kevin Costner stole ideas from Umberto Lenzi . Of course , Dances with Wolves was about an Indian tribe ; but there isn't a lot of difference . Still , I'd take Ivan Rassimov and cannibals before Kevin Costner and Indians any day ! Overall , this isn't one of the ' great ' Italian cannibal films . . . but it's not bad either .
Shallow and hard to connect with . Nice camera work though	Chungking Express is a film that was nearly lost until Quentin Tarantino and his Rolling Thunder productions company brought it to the attention of the American mainstream . . . but seriously , he shouldn't have bothered . Wong Kar-Wai's film is an aesthetic treat - it looks nice , sounds nice , I dare say it would even smell nice if it had a scent - but plainly and simply , Chungking Express lacks substance and it's 2D characters and muddled ( not to mention slow ) plotting with only leave you cold by the time the final credits ( finally ) role . The colour scheme and way that the camera moves is bound to please fans of the technical side of cinema - and it is for those reasons why I hesitate to put this down as a bad film , it's just the story side that lets it down . The film follows two separate stories , both about heartbroken policemen . They've both lost their loves and found new ones , and the film follows them through their tribulations . This wouldn't be so bad , if Wong Kar-Wai gave you any reason at all to care for them . The characters shown in this film have been given two of the most wooden profiles ever to befall a film character and although it's obvious which side of the film is most important to Kar-Wai ; at the end of the day , if a film like this fails to impact you on an emotional level - it has failed . I thought that there would be some sort of limit for how many times a song could be played in a movie , but Wong Kar-Wai obviously disagrees with that notion . The first time that The Mamas and the Papas ' " California Dreaming " lit up the screen , I was pleased . It's a very nice song . . . but after the twentieth time of hearing it , I thought that a change of track was due . The film only has three popular tracks in it , and all of them are overplayed . I've never liked Daniah Washinton's " What a Difference a Day Makes " , so hearing that didn't float my boat . . . but a Cantonese version of The Cranberries " Dreams " was a nice inclusion - but again , it's overplayed . That's the thing about this film , what it really lacks is ideas . We see characters talking to inanimate objects and dancing to California Dreaming and then , instead of seeing something else - we see the same thing again and again and again and it all gets very tiresome . Basically , this film is rated highly for two reasons : Quentin Tarantino has a lot of fans ( even though this movie has nothing to do with him really ) and the fact that everything from Asia is at the height of fashion right now . This film is worth seeing if you like to see well photographed movies with nice camera-work ; but it's an ultimately shallow experience , and people that like their movies with a bit of meat on them will be thoroughly disappointed .
Bizarre fantasy porn flick .	The Devil Inside Her mixes fantasy with porn , and the results are somewhat mixed . On the one hand , the film is completely bizarre and the sex is fairly hardcore - which is definitely to it's credit , but on the other hand , the plot sometimes gets a bit too silly , and this kind of makes the sex less easy to get on with and by the time the film reaches the halfway point , it starts to fall to bits . The plot is simple like most porn films , and focuses on two girls who are lusting over the same man . Faith is in love with Joseph , the gardener , but her father forbids it - believing the gardener not to be worthy . However , her sister Hope is also after him , and turns to the Devil to help her ? It would seem that Zebedy Colt , after the fairly imaginative opening , completely ran out of ideas by the time it came to the end - as the film pretty much degenerates into a mass orgy . Not that I have a problem with that , but it does come as being a bit on the wrong side of inventive after what went before it . Overall , I can't say that I rate The Devil Inside Her as one of my favourite porn flicks ; but it's not too bad overall , and some fans may get a kick out of it .
Better than some of the direct to video crap released recently	From the moment it starts , Twisted Sisters has ' direct to video ' written all over it . The performances are wretched ; a feat which is matched by the phoney British accents and inane dialogue , the plot is ridiculous and the film puts a focus on gore to attempt to mask these unfortunate truths . The film actually reminded me of the minor hit Murder Set-Pieces in many ways as the plot is paper thin and serves only as an excuse for some mindless gore . However , despite the fact that Nick Palumbo's film had a bit more ' bite ' with it's over the top set pieces and music score , the two films are about on par in terms of quality . The plot for this film takes obvious influence from Brian De Palma's hit Hitchcock tribute ' Sisters ' and focuses on Jennifer - a young lass who ' has it all ' . The cops begin to turn up a load of brutal murders in which the male victims have been castrated , and the blame is put on Jennifer . However , her parents later reveal that Jennifer wasn't an only child and , in fact , has a twin sister . . . This film really isn't very good , but somehow director Wolfgang Büld manages to make it entertaining in spite of that . There has been a lot of direct to video exploitation garbage released recently , from the aforementioned Murder Set Pieces to the awful August Underground and Slaughtered Vomit Dolls , all the way back to crap but fun films such as Delta Delta Die . This one would be somewhere in the middle between the rubbish and the decent stuff , as the film does at least have its moments . The conclusion to the film provides a few highlights , and despite some choppy handling throughout ; the director comes good by the end with some delightfully sick imagery that actually does fit the feel of the movie . The gore is obviously important in a film like this , and many will be glad to know that Twisted Sisters isn't short on it . Some of the set pieces in the movie are overly silly , however , and the one involving fireworks stands out both on that front , and for looking incredibly fake . Overall , this is hardly a good film ; but it has some decent moments , and fans of direct to video trash might get some enjoyment out of it .
A routine thriller . Nothing more	Presumed Innocent isn't the most original film ever made , and that's putting it lightly . Thrillers of this ilk have been made countless times , the best of which is probably Fritz Lang's excellent ' Beyond a Reasonable Doubt ' . Like said film , this one follows a man being convicted for a crime that he didn't commit , and in doing so tries to be a commentary on the justice system . However , unlike Beyond a Reasonable Doubt ; this film's commentary comes across as muddled at best . The film seems to be professing that people can be suspected of a crime through circumstantial evidence , but the way that comment is put forward is neither potent nor especially interesting ; especially as Harrison Ford's character would be the obvious prime suspect in the situation he finds himself in . We follow Ford , the assistant D . A . who , while investigating the death of a female colleague , gets the finger pointed at himself and ends up on trial for her murder . I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford . Although he doesn't often deliver an especially brilliant performance , he has a lot of charm and charisma and seeing him on screen is usually a treat . Here , he does his usual thing and carries the film adequately with it . Alan J . Pakula , a director of so-so films such as Klute and All the President's Men , directs the film . This is another so-so film , and the primary reason it fails to be great is that there's an almost complete lack of suspense . A film like this needs suspense in order to get it's audience to connect with it , but to be honest I couldn't care less whether or not our hero did it , and that wasn't helped by the fact that it's characters hardly develop at all in it's two hour running time . The lack of suspense stops this film from being a thriller per say , and renders it more of a drama come muddled justice commentary , which is a shame as an update of ' Beyond a Reasonable Doubt ' wouldn't have been such a bad thing . Kudos to the ending though , which is actually quite good . A film like this can only end in one of two ways , and that's how I expected this film to go . However , to my surprise ; it actually manages to pull out something of a surprise ending that works quite well . The film isn't worth watching to see the ending , but the ending saves it from bottom marks .
Something of a history lesson , via nunsploitation	Flavia the Heretic has been put in with the ' nunsploitation ' sub-genre , although personally I'd say it fits in closer with the historical period epic genre . Most of the time when these films say that they're " based on actual events " , you have trouble believing it ; but that's not the case here , as although I don't know anything about Italy in the 1600's , the film is of a far higher quality than most nunsploitation garbage , so it could well actually be based on a true story . I have to admit I prefer the trashier side of nunsploitation myself ; Joe D'Amato's masterpiece " Images in a Convent " being my favourite so far , but this film deserves respect for its classy and bloodthirsty historical portrait . The film focuses on the title character : Flavia . Flavia is a nun at convent that is invaded by a ' Tarantula Sect ' , and this sect proceeds to insult the nuns and their Christian beliefs by defiling their place of worship . Flavia decides that she cannot take this blasphemy , and flees the convent , with revenge in mind . . . The blood , sex and violence in this film actually has more power than that in a lot of similar movies . The whole film is very realistic , and this is a huge benefit to it as this allows director Gianfranco Mingozzi to create a truly macabre and morbid atmosphere . Much of the plot goes towards building up the central character , and this sets Flavia the Heretic apart from many of it's seventies counterparts as it means that the character gets developed in a way that makes sense , and it's clear that the director and everyone involved wanted to make a serious piece of art . Florinda Bolkan is excellent in the title role , and brings some real credibility to the film alongside a good support cast . There are some truly nasty sequences in this film ; including many shots of people being spiked , a decapitation , a very realistic ' skinning ' scene and plenty of rough sex . But none of this appears out of place as the director ensures that the graphic violence fits with the rest of the film . Overall , I can't call Flavia the Heretic a favourite of mine ; but it deserves more respect than a lot of these films do , and it's definitely worth seeing .
Just does what you expect	I cant remember much about the original ' Anaconda ' , save for the fact that I didn't like it much ; but even so , I knew going into this silly jungle adventure that I was going to enjoy myself . The Anaconda sequel goes the same way as Aliens , in that it adds an ' s ' to the end of the original title instead of having a number 2 there . Unlike Aliens , however , this film isn't all that good . But then again . . . nobody expects it to be , and in terms of the ' fun factor ' , Anacondas definitely does it's job . Many criticise this flick for the fact that it's not brilliant - but that's just stupid if you ask me . If you're expecting brilliance going into a sequel to a low-key nineties horror thriller ; it's YOU who should be criticised . Anyway , Anacondas spends about two minutes spread over one scene setting it's plot up , and then we're off into the jungle . The plot revolves around , as the sub-title suggests , a hunt for a rare flower that supposedly has life-giving qualities . But the real point of the film is people getting eaten by over-sized snakes . . . The huge snakes are brought to life by computer-generated effects . For CGI , the effects aren't too bad ; but as usual , they completely fail to be impressive . The snakes look good while they're meandering through the water , but when we get to see them properly ; they just look mundane . The film is , of course , set in the Amazon jungle ; and that is one of this film's main assets . The jungle always provides a great setting for thrillers , because there's just so much wonder within it . Aside from snakes , we also get spiders , crocodiles and various other grisly beasts for out heroes to contend with . The cast is typically made up of unknowns , and none of them really impress . Johnny Messner is the best of them , and he takes the lead role as the rugged captain of the boat that takes the team of researchers through the jungle . On the whole , Anacondas pretty much delivers what you would expect it to deliver . There's plenty of action , plenty of snakes and not a lot in the way of plot or characters . Of course , it doesn't matter ; and I can recommend this film to anyone that simply wants ninety minutes of easy viewing .
Merely decent seventies TV movie	A Little Game is decent enough for a TV movie , although it's a long way from being brilliant . The film takes obvious influence from the likes of The Bad Seed , in that it follows a young problem child with murder in mind . There were some really good seventies TV movies , so while this one is OK in its own right , it pales in comparison to some of its counterparts . The main problem with the film is that the problem child fails to be intimidating and comes off as being more pathetic than frightening . Mark Gruner was clearly the wrong kid for the central role - and that's a shame as the film really rests on his shoulders . Obviously , you can't expect great things from a film like this ; but unfortunately this one does little more than merely tell a story , and the story itself doesn't have much more to it than just the central theme . I imagine that this may have been better when caught on TV in the seventies than it was for me watching it on DVD at home , but basically it hasn't aged well and there isn't much to it . I'm not saying it's not worth bothering with - but it's certainly not worth going out of your way for either .
Enjoyable high camp werewolf mystery . . . .	Amicus are a studio most famous for putting out horror anthologies ; but they did a couple of feature length horror films , mostly with mixed results . The Beast Must Die could easily be described as a mixed result all by itself . On the one hand , it's based on a fun premise , which does a great job of getting the audience involved in the film ; yet it doesn't quite work . The werewolf sub-genre is full of failures , but this film can't quite be considered such because it's not really a werewolf film . The werewolf plot is only in the film to tie it to the horror genre , which Amicus had so much success with ; and the real point of the film is the mystery . In the style of the great William Castle film , ' The Tingler ' - The Beast Must Die talks to it's audience , and actively involves them in the search for the wolf . The plot follows a hunter who invites six guests to his country mansion on the basis that one of them is a werewolf . The full moon cycle lasts for three days , and our hero vows to find out which one is the werewolf , and kill that person , before the three days are up . . . The Beast Must Die profits from its cast . Headed by Peter Cushing ( who dons a very silly accent ) , The Beast Must Die benefits from a stellar English cast including Anton Diffring , Michael Gambon and Calvin Lockhart ( who's actually from the Bahamas ) in the lead role . The film is high camp throughout , and director Paul Annett does a good job of ensuring that The Beast Must Die never becomes too serious . The mystery itself takes the lead over the horror element , but that's not a problem because going into this film , you really should be expecting a mystery thriller , not essentially a horror flick . The film is a long way from being a perfect piece of camp , however , as it gets a little too boring at times ; and the fact that there isn't a lot of wolf will no doubt annoy certain viewers . The mystery isn't exactly brilliant either , but by the end - it really could have been anyone , making the ' guess the werewolf ' game fun ; but a bit pointless , as the rest of the film hasn't narrowed it down . I enjoyed this film a lot ; but wouldn't recommend going out of one's way to find it .
Decent fantasy horror , but not much more	The Witches of Eastwick blends a number of genres , including fantasy , horror and comedy , and somehow blends them all into a mostly coherent film about lust , sin and the age-old idea of ' be careful what you wish for ' . I have to say that the film isn't really what I expected , as the title suggests witchcraft and this film is more angled around the drama surrounding the loneliness of its three central women , with some tentative satanic themes thrown in . Director George Miller has seen fit to cast all the central roles with strong personalities ; and while Jack Nicholson stands out the most , the themes of the story and the other performer's aren't lost under his star profile . The plot centres on three New England women ( Cher , Susan Sarandon and Michele Pfeiffer ) who , bored with their lives , inadvertently conjure up the man of their dreams . Soon after , their town of ' Eastwick ' is graced by the presence of Daryl Van Horne ( Nicholson ) , a wealthy and handsome man who manages to satisfy the desires of all three women . However , Daryl has his own sinister motives . . . It has to be said the plotting is rather hit and miss , as the film features great slices of acting ; such as the scene between jack Nicholson and Cher in his bedroom , but then this is offset by a lot of very silly instances , and what could have been a great film is marred by a too prominent sense of humour . Jack Nicholson is a delight to watch , however , as he lights up the screen at every opportunity and ensures that the film is always at least worth watching . Cher is my pick of the female leads as she provides the strongest and most memorable female character in the film . Both Susan Sarandon and Michelle Pfeiffer are decent enough , but don't particularly stand out . The themes of the plot don't come across too well , and at times I wondered whether this film actually had a point to make or not . The director also seems to keen not to show any nudity , and this is a shame as The Witches of Eastwick features prominent themes of lust throughout , so some nudity wouldn't have gone amiss . But even so , despite many flaws and inconsistencies ; The Witches of Eastwick is fun enough for a single viewing .
Not Lewton's best film , but a good exhibition of eerie atmosphere	The Ghost Ship was put together because RKO pictures wanted another film to be made using the existing sets from their earlier film , Pacific Liner . This shows somewhat , as the film has something of a rushed and unfinished feel to it ; but there's nobody better than Val Lewton for the task of putting together an eerie thriller , and considering the reasons why this was made ; he hasn't done a bad job at all . The film isn't up there with his best work - films such as Cat People , I Walked With a Zombie and The Body Snatcher - but I still rate this as a successful production credit for the man , and as an eerie sea bound thriller ; it definitely works . The plot is simple ( probably as a result of the reason that the film was made ) and it follows a ship whose third mate suspects that the captain may be the one murdering the crew , some members of which have been dying under mysterious circumstances . We then follow a familiar psychological drama formula , which is fleshed out by some set pieces typical of Lewton's films . The atmosphere , as usual with Lewton , is right on cue and makes up the backbone of the movie . The smoky setting compliments the isolation of being at sea nicely , and the film always seems interesting and foreboding for this reason . The story is weak and somewhat dull for the first half hour of the movie - and this is somewhat due to the lack in atmosphere . The first half does treat us to the film's best set-piece - a man being crushed by a huge chain ( no less ! ) - but you'll have to wait until the second half before the movie really picks up . As you would expect from Lewton , the film is never gratuitous , but during the second half the story starts to pick up , and as the tension mounts , director Mark Robson allows the film to reach it's climatic conclusion . Mark Robson isn't the best director that Lewton worked with - and all of his movies have been lesser entries in the great producer's list of film credits , but he knows what he's doing and this is another decent film from him . On the whole - you'll probably want to see the Jacques Tourneur collaborations , along with The Body Snatcher first - but after you've seen those , this is a good place to go next .
A decent Giallo that adds nothing new	The Giallo genre was at the end of its heyday in 1973 and ended up giving way to the more action orientated Polizi films towards the middle of the seventies . There were still a few Giallo's being made after 1973 , but the genre never really reached the heights it did in the early seventies . Mario Moroni's " Clap , You're Dead " obviously takes influence from the later Polizi films ; but retains enough of the common Giallo to still be considered a part of the genre . Aside from offering up a plot that includes murder and a detective story , the director has also seen fit to lampoon the film-making process . . . with largely mixed results . We focus on the production of some trashy horror movie helmed by a hack director . Things go awry when one of the actresses turns up dead and things get even more awry when things go wrong with the production and even more people end up dead . The police begin to suspect Richard ; a man sacked from the production , and mounts an investigation into the crimes . The film actually gets off to a fairly intriguing start ; the first murder comes fairly early on and although the director leads us to believe that the film is going to be bloodless ; it does at least promise a possibly entertaining mystery plot . Things heat up a bit after the first murder and the film appears to be keeping a good pace ; until about the half hour mark when the focus shifts more towards the police investigation , and then things quickly become less interesting as the pace slows down . There are a few murder scenes in the film ; although as mentioned they are mostly bloodless and that is a shame . The movie set is actually a fairly good place for it all to take place and while the parody doesn't exactly hit the mark , the film does at least provide some interesting characters . It all boils down to a ' showpiece ' ending that gathers up most of the surviving cast and provides a nice conclusion to the mystery . Overall , this is decent enough for a single watch ; but I'd only really recommend it to seasoned Giallo enthusiasts .
Even in space , you'll still be able to hear them scream . . .	Screamers takes obvious influence from a whole range of Sci-Fi films , including Aliens , The Terminator and The Thing and somehow manages to bring everything together to form a coherent and exciting movie . Futuristic action movies were in vogue in the nineties after the successful release of Terminator 2 , and this is certainly one of the better releases since James Cameron's masterpiece sequel . Director Christian Duguay presents a good futuristic atmosphere , which is all the better given the fact that this movie was made before CGI became part and parcel of action films . The locations are good , and it's easy to believe that the film really is taking place on a distant planet . Screamers takes place on a mining colony known as Sirius 6B . The planet has been at war for ten years , and one of the results of this war is the creation of the deadly ' Screamers ' , a machine that has the ability to maim and replicate its victims . However , what the scientists who created them didn't count on is the evolution of the machines post man's control , and this is proving a problem for Colonel Hendricksson , as it's not easy to tell the difference between people and machines anymore . . . Christian Duguay evidently decided that it would be a good idea to play it safe with the lead star and opted to cast Peter Weller , who had been tried and tested in futuristic actioners almost a decade earlier with Paul Verhoeven's Robocop . Weller makes for a good B-movie lead as although he's no Arnold Schwarzenegger ; he looks strong and knows his way around an action scene . However , for me he's a weak link in an otherwise strong film , as he doesn't look interesting enough and has a hard time when it comes to the emotional scenes . The rest of the cast is good , despite there not being any big names on board , and Jennifer Rubin provides eye candy as the female interest . The film is very imaginative , and while the effects aren't always solid ; they're well used and seeing all the different things that the title villains can do is always a highlight . The action sequences are exciting , and while some scenes feel very derivative of Aliens ; Screamers works because it's always exciting and the fast pace benefits it immensely . Overall , this film is a good B-movie and while it's certainly no masterpiece , Screamers comes recommended to action and Sci-Fi fans .
Deodato's disappointing crime flick effort	Considering Italian directors ' penchant for ripping off popular American films , it took Ruggero Deodato an age to cash in on Dirty Harry ! But , he did eventually get round to it ; and Live Like a Cop , Die Like a Man is the result . Ruggero Deodato would become famous for his pair of violent cannibal films , Jungle Holocaust and Cannibal Holocaust , and while this flick is nowhere near as shocking as those two , it's still bears Deodato's touch as it's a shade nastier than a lot of the cop films released in Italy circa 1971 ( though still not as nasty as Umberto Lenzi's milestone , Almost Human ) . However , despite its nasty edge ; Live Like a Cop , Die Like a Man lacks a certain something , and I certainly won't be naming it as one of the best films of it's type . The plot focuses on a couple of maverick policemen ; Fred and Tony , who are members of the ' special squad ' , a department of the police . They have a licence to kill and aren't afraid to use it , and most of the film basically follows our trigger happy cops around as they blow everyone away . One thing I love about Italian films from the seventies is the titles ! This one is particularly good , as it takes a swipe at coppers by stating that ' cops ' and ' men ' are different things . . . The central characters were obviously intended to be gritty scene-stealers along the same lines as Tomas Milian in a lot of Lenzi's crime films ; but unfortunately , they both come off as rather ridiculous . They're barely cops at all ( the story would have been better and made more sense if they were vigilantes ) , and they're both too young for this ' special squad ' status - it never really washes . Furthermore , neither Marc Porel nor Ray Lovelock manages to put in a decent performance . The film isn't a complete loss mostly thanks to Ruggero Deodato's handling . The action scenes are brash and exciting , and Deodato does manage to implement a few standout scenes amongst a fair bit of tedium . Unfortunately , the film doesn't really end on a high either , and while there are a lot worse films than this out there in the Italian cop genre - there are a lot of better ones too . This film is not a dead loss , but it's not really recommended either .
The sinful Mundae sisters up to no good . . .	I saw the nymphet Misty Mundae for the first time in the best episode of the patchy Masters of Horror series ; Lucky McKee's " Sick Girl " , and have been hoping to catch one of her soft porn flicks for a while since . Sin Sisters , therefore , is my first Misty Mundae porno , and while it's difficult to be over-impressed with a film as lacking as this one , Sin Sisters succeeds both as a porn flick and ( almost ) as a thriller , so I can't be too hard on it . It's obvious that the behinds the scenes crew at Seduction Cinema aren't exactly cinema geniuses , as numerous sequences in this film go on far too long ; and despite the fact that the three female leads spend most of the film without much on ; the overall result isn't very erotic , and this is only slightly better than what your average Joe with a video camera could do . . . but I suppose it would be silly to expect anything else . The plot focuses on two sisters ; Cynthia and Morgana ( played by real life sisters Misty and Chelsea Mundae ) , who accidentally murder someone at their college and end up packing the body into the boot of their car . However , while on the way to dump it ; they come across a playful Julian Wells . . . ' Cheap and nasty ' is a phrase I would use to describe Sin Sisters ' cinematography as it's extremely bland and looks like it cost the studio but a few pennies . Director Tony Marsiglia relies heavily on his lead star and doesn't seem to care too much about the rest of the film . It's not hard to see why Misty Mundae is so popular either , as despite not being your average porn star and looking about fourteen ; there's something captivating about her , and the paradox between her innocent looks and filthy actions gives her a style of her own . Chelsea Mundae , unfortunately , hasn't quite got her sister's charm ; but the film is given an extra dimension courtesy of the experienced Julian Wells , who is chalk to Mundae's cheese . The scenes between the three leads aren't as good as they could be , and sequences that see the younger girls recite every possible name for various body parts is an unwelcome intrusion . The music used helps to enforce the cheap porno atmosphere , and while this movie would have benefited from better production values , a competent director and more variety ; if you're after some soft porn , this may well do the trick . . .
Not the sort of Poe I'm used to	Spirits of the Dead is an anthology based on the writing of the great Edgar Allen Poe ; but anyone going into this expecting something as entertaining as Roger Corman's Poe films is liable to be sorely disappointed as entertainment was clearly not high on the filmmakers ' list of priorities . The film is split into three stories ; each of them directed by one of the ' greats ' of international cinema . While I'm a big fan of any film that bears his name in the writing credits ; I do have to admit that aside from a couple of poems , I have not read anything by the great writer . However , from the films I have seen ; I do have a very good idea of Poe's style - yet this film really doesn't encompass that at all and in fact , I was really surprised to find that this film is often labelled as ' horror ' , as while some of the stories in this anthology are slightly unsettling ; the film is more of an arty drama on the whole and despite the fact that it's based on Poe's writings ; it's not a must see for horror followers . Apparently , there's an American and International version of this film ; and unfortunately I saw the International version so I missed the narration by the great Vincent Price . The first of the three stories is entitled " Metzengerstein " and directed by Roger Vadim ; from whom the disappointing Blood and Roses is the only film I've seen . The most interesting thing about this story is the casting ; with the director's then wife Jane Fonda starring alongside her brother Peter Fonda . The story concerns a cold and unflinching baroness falling in love with cousin . The story doesn't get boring really ; but it is very slow . The second story is the most disappointing ; directed by Louis Malle ; it's a weird story of dual identities , made interesting only by the ending and the casting of Brigitte Bardot . Fellini's segment is the final one and probably the best of the three , although it's not the director's best work by a long shot . Terence Stamp gives a chilling portrayal at least . Overall , this film may appeal to art house fans ; although there's better art house films than this and horror fans will get their kicks elsewhere too .
Decent seventies made for TV movie	All the Kind Strangers is basically just your average made for TV seventies movie - in that it features an interesting base plot , and lets that fill the entire runtime without even attempting to do anything else with it . The result is adequate ; though underwhelming . The film begins with a man driving through the woods alone . He encounters a young boy and offers to give him a lift home . Upon arriving at the boy's home , the man finds it inhabited by children ; and because his car won't start , he decides to stay there for the night . However , it turns out that the kids have broken his car to make him stay with them as they want him to be their father . The film only runs for about seventy five minutes and doesn't provide a great deal of surprises along the way . Once the plot is laid out , we are left only with the task of getting to the end . The film does feature a good leading performance from Stacy Keach , who gets into his character well and receives good feedback from the likes of Samantha Eggar and John Savage . It all boils down to a rather strange , yet disappointing ending . Overall , this is a long way from being great ; but it passes the time at least and I'd say it's just about worth a look .
Decent third showing for Blade , but nothing brilliant	I was never a big fan of the original ' Blade ' , but I liked the sequel a lot . Doing away with the story building of the first one , Blade II captured a nice balance between plot and action and it was an entertaining ride throughout . For this third instalment , however that perfect balance has been interrupted , and calling this film ' action heavy ' would be an understatement . While the action in the movie is well done and entertaining to watch , when you've seen 45th bad guy being smashed through a window , it loses it's impact somewhat . The talking scenes in between the action are either small plot details that the film needs to string itself together , or just another action sequence set-up . The plot is messy to say the least , and there's far too much going on for it to be streamlined into an engaging and satisfying story , but nevertheless it follows the vampires as they resurrect legendary bloodsucker Dracula and get Blade into trouble with the cops . However , Blade manages to team up with a ragtag bunch of vampire hunters and together they attempt to thwart Dracula and the rest of the vampires ! Oh , and the cops . David S . Goyer , the man who wrote the first two Blade films has taken the director's chair this time round . He's obviously being watching too much Mtv too , as he seems far too keen to not allow the audience to know what is going on . The quick style Mtv editing is abundant , and it quickly becomes apparent that you will end up very dizzy by the end of the film . The director / writer has dragged together an eclectic cast to compliment Wesley Snipes , which includes the sizzling Jessica Biel , along with two more experienced actresses who should know better ; Parker Posey and Natasha Lyonne , and Kris Kristofferson returns also ; and WWF wrestler Triple H joins in the fun too . Wesley Snipes has made his name playing the human / vampire hybrid in this comic strip movie series , and with this performance he seems like an actor bored with his work . Whether or not that's because of the extremely thin caricature that Snipes has been given to work with this time round , or maybe it's because he's fed up of ' more of the same ' . Anyway , Blade Trinity is quality entertainment . What it lacks in depth , it makes up for in coolness and action and if you liked the first two , you might as well see this one as well .
Very well made modern horror flick !	In a time when remakes , sequels and sequels to remakes are just about all the horror genre is getting , it's refreshing to a see a film that isn't merely a copy of another . This film isn't completely original , however , as it has shades of classics such as Alien and The Thing , but the base of the plot is compelling and the way that director Billy O'Brien patiently builds up the atmosphere and tension is impressive . The plot obviously takes influence from the agricultural crisis's we've had in Britain over the last few years ; namely foot and mouth , in which the desire not to have people coming and going from various farms was strong . The film starts with a cow giving birth . There's obviously a problem from the outset , and it increases when the cow is born . The calf is somehow not right , and the farmers take the decision to kill it . Upon dissecting the dead calf , it turns out that there's a parasite growing inside of it , and we soon learn that this is the result of an experiment carried out with the farmer's say so by an immoral vet . . . The film is slow to start , and the first half is really just build up . However , the build up isn't boring and the director generates suspense by never really letting us know what is going on until it is really needed . The second half the film is entirely different to the first as then we focus more on action and gore , and this actually goes well with the beginning of the movie . There aren't many characters in the film , and that means that there aren't a lot of death scenes ; but this isn't too important as the central monster looks cool enough , and the death scenes are suitably nasty , even though they're not very gory . The locations the atmosphere is a big stand out , and the director does a good job of ensuring the farm location is integral to the plot and good use of the dirty and eerie locations is used at all times . The film is a long way away from being perfect ; the camera-work annoyed me somewhat as Billy O'Brien obviously subscribes to the flashy camera-work school of thought , and sometimes you can't see what's going on . However , this is a well made and well acted little horror film that deserves more plaudits for the fact that it's not a direct rip off . Very well done !
Maverick Merli busts organised crime	Convoy Busters may not be the best Polizi movie ever to come out of Italy , but it's certainly an above average crime romp with a great cast and more action packed stunt sequences than you can shake a stick at ! The film is set up a little differently to most of the Polizi movies that I've seen , as it's a movie of two halves and a lot of it takes place in settings unlike the thick urban atmosphere I've come to associate with this sort of movie ; namely , a quiet seaside town and the rural countryside . Most of these films take influence from Dirty Harry , and Convoy Buster is no different as Maurizio Merli's maverick copper has a definite Clint Eastwood vibe about him ; but the fact that it's a little different gives Convoy Busters a lot of credibility in my opinion . The story starts when the dead body of a young girl is found with her throat cut . Commissioner Olmi takes the case , but when his violent methods leave an innocent man dead ; he gets transferred to a quiet coastal town . However , the fact that it's quiet doesn't mean there isn't any organised crime . . . This is the first Polizi I've seen from director Stelvio Massi , and while it doesn't rival the likes of Umberto Lenzi and Enzo G . Castellari , I'm definitely interested in checking out more from him . Massi's handling is generally very good , and while the plot does have a few problems ; certain sequences - the one in which the inspector shoots a few crooks from a helicopter in particular - are real standouts . There's plenty of action to keep the audience entertained throughout and it comes through in a steady stream . The stunts range from a very well done bar room brawl to a great sequence that sees Merli smash through a school window . The leading man puts in an excellent performance . He can look a little silly at times , but generally he fits the role very well and this was more than enough to keep this Eurocrime fan happy . It has to be said that Convoy Busters doesn't work from the most imaginative of scripts , but this isn't too important as Massi is more than equal to the task of making sure that what he has to work with is always entertaining as a film like this should be . Overall , Convoy Busters is well worth seeing and I certainly recommend it .
Derivative but well made slasher with some good ideas	The slasher flick was in full swing by 1982 and the release of this film , and so it was starting to near the time when the idea would have to be played with if the sub-genre was to survive . First time writer-director Jack Sholder , therefore , came up with the idea for this film ; which follows most of the traditions of the slasher flick , only this time we get treated to four psychopathic killers rather than just one . That small originality aside , however , what we have here is basically just another slasher film ; as we've got babysitters being stalked and killed , a bunch of innocent victims and several sharp implements taking a starring role . The plot follows Dan Potter ; a new doctor at a mental hospital , in which all the doors are kept locked by a system running entirely on electricity . He gets off to a bad start with his new patients when it transpires that they believe he killed their old doctor whom they trusted . Things then take a turn for the worse when the town is hit by a blackout and all the locks in the hospital are released . No prizes for guessing who the lunatics make their primary target . . . The film benefits from a trio of central performances from great older actors . Donald Pleasance clearly got his role as head doctor at the hospital through Halloween , but Academy Award winners Jack Palance and Martin Landau do well in their roles , and the fact that much of the cast is made up of older actors instantly gives this film more credibility than it's mostly teen-starring counterparts . The rest of the cast are mostly unknowns , but there are no real weak links in this film as everyone does a decent job . The central theme of being ' alone in the dark ' isn't put to as good use as it could have been , as only the climatic siege really sees the lead characters plunged into the dark , but the film is well made and director Jack Sholder implements several well shot and exciting sequences into the film , the best of which include looting in a big department store and , best of all , the clichéd yet well done scene that sees a babysitter killed . I may rate this film a little higher if it wasn't a slasher ; as said films aren't my favourite , but overall this is a well made and exciting eighties cult film and comes recommended , especially to slasher fans .
Certainly one of the better Naschy werewolf flicks !	Paul Naschy made a hell of a lot of horror films and , unfortunately , many of them are somewhat less than brilliant . His " Hombre-Lobo " cycle is a set of films that sometimes gets some attention and this film is a part of that series . I've seen two previously - Werewolf Shadow and ' The Werewolf and the Yeti ' , which somehow managed to make it onto the Video Nasty list . I'm not a fan of either film at all and I feared this may be another bad example of the cycle , but to my surprise , Curse of the Devil is actually quite good ! The main inspiration obviously comes from the Universal classic ' The Wolf Man ' and features an upstanding citizen struck with the curse of changing into a werewolf every full moon . It's one of those deals where an ancient ancestor messed with the wrong people and it's turned out bad for Count Waldemar Daninsky as he becomes the afflicted generation . A witch instructs a beautiful naked woman to put the curse on Daninsky with the aid of a wolf's skull . She has sex with him first and then does the honours , leaving the Count with a bit of a problem . Spanish horror tends to be a bit slow , and that is the case here ; though it's not a big problem as the film is always at least interesting and it's not as slow as some other examples . The title is a bit misleading and alludes to something more along the lines of Satanic horror , though obviously that's not the case ; the ' curse ' part makes some sense though . Paul Naschy delivers another good performance that fits his character , though he gets a lot of experience playing the same kind of roles so a good performance should really be expected . The werewolf effects appear to have been based on the Universal classic and possibly Hammer Horror's The Curse of the Werewolf too . I can't say they're very convincing , but there is a change sequence that's amusing . There's not a great deal of gore in the film but this is made up for by the way that the film delves into the werewolf legend . I can't say that this is a great film or a great werewolf film ; but it's an enjoyable one and for my money the best of the three " Hombre-Lobo " films that I've seen .
Entertaining , but it lacks bite and emotion	Martin Scorsese's Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film . It's got hits , bad language , Robert DeNiro , gambling , lots of Italian Americans - it's all there . Furthermore , it's got a great soundtrack , the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good . . . but somehow , this just isn't a great film . Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion . There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie , and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole . The movie also follows the common Scorsese format , in that some guy gets rich and respected , then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started . In fact , the ending of this movie is only an " I'm a schmo " away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas . Still , at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it's runtime , and it's easy to forgive the flaws when you're watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who's head he's jammed into a vice . Casino lasts almost three hours , and it's fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong . It's not so bad for the first two hours , but once the film enters the final third ; cracks begin to appear and the film isn't as interesting as it was , not much unlike Goodfellas ; which also suffered from a trite final third . Tarantino's influence on cinema is felt in this movie , and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in ' cool ' old classics . Still , some of these songs ; such as Fleetwood Mac's " Go Your Own Way " and The Animals ' " The House of the Rising Sun " are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen . For this movie , Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci , and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film . Casino may well be DeNiro's last great performance before he went on his downward spiral , which started with the fellow 1995 movie " Heat " . On the whole , while this film is technically sound , it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off . It's an entertaining ride , but it's one that is ultimately shallow .
The price of vanity . . .	The story of Elizabeth Bathory is easily one of the most important for the horror genre , and there's no studio more qualified to tackle said story than the legendary Hammer studios . . . but unfortunately , the resulting film is not as great as it could have been . Hammer had their golden period from the late fifties until the end of the sixties , and I dare say that if this film was released during that period , it would have been one of their classics . By the seventies , the studio had began to take influence from the lurid Euro horror films that were gaining popularity , and this resulted in Hammer losing it's innocence ; which if you ask me , was what made them great in the first place . However , Countess Dracula is still one of Hammer's most inspiring films and benefits from a typically ludicrous plot line . We follow the Countess who , by chance , discovers that the blood of virgins restores her youth . After becoming young again , she pretends to be her own daughter and begins courting the son of a soldier ; much to the annoyance of her present lover . However , nothing lasts forever ; and bathing in the blood of virgins is something the Countess must continue to do if she is to retain her vanity ? As mentioned , the way that the plot is handled isn't very good . The film plays out like a drama rather than a horror movie and there is barely any tension or suspense to found throughout the whole picture . It seems that director Peter Sasdy ( who also made the very decent Taste the Blood of Dracula for Hammer ) thought that the implications of the plot would be enough to carry it ; and while this is true to an extent , the film does become a little too dreary at times . Another disappointing element of the film is that , despite the fact that it's about a woman who bathes in blood ; we never actually get to see this taking place . I was really hoping to see the beautiful Ingrid Pitt relaxing in a bath of blood , but no ! ? I don't know , perhaps it would have been a little too graphic . The lead actress really does make the film her own , however and delivers a powerhouse performance that proves her worthy of the title of Hammer's best leading lady . The way that the film carries off the plot is really good , also , and we are allowed into the head of all three central figures . On the whole , I can't say that this is one of Hammer's best films , but despite its faults ; I really enjoyed it .
Stylish and slick Brit horror flick !	This low budget British horror flick pretty much flew straight under the radar upon release towards the end of 2004 , and while the film doesn't deserve the status of a classic , or even a modern genre classic ; Creep still offers a good , horrific eighty minutes and fans of classically plotted horror thrillers will no doubt enjoy themselves . The film is very thin on plot , and works just from a premise - the premise being that Franke Potente has found herself trapped in the subway after hours . This wouldn't be so bad , but she's got a strange mutant on her tail that seems to delight in murdering everyone around her ! While this plot doesn't really allow the audience to engage with it due to the fact that it is so shallow , director Christopher Smith keeps the film ticking over with an onslaught of suspense and tension brought about by the claustrophobic landscape of the tunnels underneath London and the fairly generous helping of disgusting gore effects , which are a nice addition to any horror movie if you ask me . If the film has any sort of commentary on the state of the management of London's subways , it's muddled at best ? but it doesn't matter , as nobody sees this sort of thing for social comments anyway . The effects of the ' creep ' itself are actually quite good . The monster is mutated enough to be visibly inhuman , but it retains enough of it's human form to be recognisably humane in some way . The creature effects in this film seem to have been a big influence on fellow recent Brit horror ' The Descent ' , as the monsters in that film very much resembles the one in this . Franke Potente knows a lot about running since her big hit was the highly acclaimed German drama ' Run Lola Run ' , and she gets to stretch her legs in this film more than just a bit too . The frantic pace of the film really makes it what it is , and while there's nothing in this film that you haven't seen before ; the movie takes it's borrowed elements and moulds them together into a slick horror cocktail . The fact that it's only on for eighty minutes will ensure that you wont get bored in spite of it's thin premise , and if a short running time isn't good enough for you ; the gritty gore certainly will be , as this film features lots of grappling , stabbing , gutting and many other such things . It would seem that the director has an eye for visuals too , as he presents a few of them - the best being the bloodied hand reaching up from under a train !
Tarantino enters Spaghetti Western mode	The first part to Quentin Tarantino's overly violent and exploitative revenge epic was a love letter addressed to Japanese Pink films and Kung Fu flicks . This second part is his homage to Spaghetti Westerns . The main difference between the styles of the two films is the pace - while the original was fast and furious , this one is a much more thoughtful and drawn out affair and while that may intrigue some viewers more ; I have to say that Volume 1 did more for me . Still , it's quite clear Tarantino surely knows how to make a bona fide cult film and thoroughly entertain his audience on the way - and this film succeeds in doing that admirably . The plot is very simple and follows on directly from the first film . Having ticked off the first two names from her ' death list ' , The Bride now closes in on the final three killers that ruined her wedding day - Budd , Ellie Driver and of course , Bill himself . The film follows The Bride as she tracks down the killers , also filling us in further on the story of the revenge and her relationship with Bill . The key to this film's success is really very simple - colourful characters and sharp dialogue . I have to be honest and say that I found the script for Kill Bill Volume 2 to be weaker than some of his previous efforts with much of the dialogue coming off as being extremely forced - but this is a comic book thrill ride at it's best and the characters themselves shine all the way through . As mentioned previously , the film is much slower than the first one , although there's plenty going on and the first hour and twenty minutes is a constant thrill ride complete with menacing characters and grisly situations ( though nothing to rival the amazing climax to Volume 1 ) . Of course , the entire two part epic is a build up to the central character carrying out the title's statement and Tarantino really had a lot of promise to deliver on with the ending . Anyone hoping for a spectacular face off ( me for example ) will be extremely disappointed , however . David Carradine does get lots of opportunities to justify his place in the film - he's by far the most natural actor in terms of how he delivers his dialogue and Tarantino rewards this by giving him plenty of interesting things to say ; but the final showdown is over far too quickly . The film has other problems too ; the biggest being some very silly and difficult to believe sequences ( such as the flashback during The Bride's talk with Bill ) that bring it down a little , but in spite of that ; this is still a very good cult film that should not disappoint too many people that loved Volume 1 .
Very good eighties cop thriller	Deadly Pursuit certainly has it's fair share of problems , but as an entertaining little action thriller ; it stands up well to criticism , as while some of the dialogue , situations and character drawings don't exactly ring true ; the film moves quickly and director Roger Spottiswoode does a good job of ensuring that the film is easy viewing and never becomes boring . Deadly Pursuit is something of a film of two halves ; it starts off as a gritty cop thriller , and then mutates into a survivalist themed chase movie . The plot is fairly standard at first , as we witness a man being caught robbing a diamond store . The plot thickens when , after some interrogation from the arresting officers , it turns out that the thief actually owns the store ! We then learn that he's stealing the diamonds to pay a kidnapper for the release of his wife . FBI agent Warren Stantin manages to chase the kidnapper down , but he gets away with the diamonds and flees into a forest near Canada ; thus meaning that Agent Stantin must chase the killer into the woods , with the help of a rugged local who knows the area . The film does have a number of problems - sometimes , for example , it seems to just jump from one scene to the next without much in the way of a connection . This does keep things moving , but the film can feel a bit disjointed because of it . Still , the plot flows fairly well and enough different angles are created to keep things interesting . The film features a decent cast , headed up by Sidney Poitier . Poitier's character changes a lot through the film , and while the actor sometimes looks a bit silly , he does seem to manage this well . He is joined by Tom Berenger , who also gives a decent performance in his role , while the rest of the cast is filled out by the likes of Clancy Brown , Kirstie Alley and Andrew Robinson . Perhaps the best thing about this movie is the fact that we don't know who the killer is for so long , which builds suspense - and mystery , and the film also carries off a nice twist little twist with the choice of actors surrounding the killer . Overall , I can't really say that Deadly Pursuit is one of the best films of its type - but it's certainly a very good thriller and I recommend watching it !
Young prodigy starts fires in one of the best Stephen King adaptations !	Despite the fact that the films usually revolve around good and interesting stories , film adaptations of Stephen King's works are often not the best horror movies . Firestarter isn't the best known of his books , and that's slightly odd as this film adaptation is one of the best based on his stories . The film takes obvious influence from Brian De Palma's ' The Fury ' , as aside from the fact that this one is about a young girl that can start fires , and De Palma's film features a boy with psychic abilities ; the way that both plots play out is very similar indeed . The plot has a number of problems , and the characters don't always act logically ; but this is offset by the likable nature of the film , and characters that are easy to get along with due to their relatively simplistic nature . The film follows the aftermath of an experiment in which people were given an experimental drug . The ultimate result of this experiment was a child born of Andy and Vicky McGee ; a child with a unique ability known as ' pyrokinesis ' - the ability to start fires at will . The film benefits from a range of cult stars . A young Drew Barrymore takes the title role , and although her acting skills hadn't been honed by the time this film was released , and she is more than a little bit wooden ; she provides an interesting lead . David Keith and Martin Sheen back her up well in supporting roles , but the main acting plaudits go to the great George C . Scott who is good in what is probably the meatiest role of the piece . The running time is a little long for a film like this , but it's well used and the fact that the story doesn't get caught up with needless elements such as the girl's mother and father falling in love is definitely a good thing . The plot is very relaxed for most of the way through , and director Mark L . Lester seems content to just let things play out . That is until the last fifteen minutes ; when the plot reaches its full potential and explodes with a fun and exciting finale . The film does feel more than a little bit like a TV movie at times ; and the dumbed down techno soundtrack doesn't help this . Overall , the film definitely isn't perfect ; but it's an enjoyable watch and King films have definitely been a lot worse !
History , comic book style !	It was obvious after the success of Sin City that we were going to see more of Frank Miller's graphic novels adapted for the screen , and someone was obviously impressed enough with Zack Snyder's visuals on the dire Dawn of the Dead remake to give him the directing reigns . I have to say , I'm not the biggest fan of period epics ; but I knew that wouldn't be a problem going into this film as Frank Miller obviously has a very over the top style , and as soon as I heard that it's " very gory " , I was sold . I have to say that this film is not as great as Sin City ; the visuals aren't as good , the film isn't handled as well and the central plot thread isn't as interesting as Sin City's three narratives ; but 300 is still a spectacular piece of cinema . The film focuses on the war between the Spartans and the Persians in 480 B . C . A group of 300 Spartans , lead by the fearless King Leonidas , moves in on the advancing Persian army . The warriors are massively outnumbered , but thanks to their impregnable strategy ; the few manage to out fight the many for a short time . I haven't read Frank Miller's graphic novel , but I'm guessing that certain sequences were based on it pretty much frame for frame . While this is good in some ways as it allows Snyder to capture the comic book style , in other ways it's very bad as some shots look completely out of place , and make it seem like Snyder doesn't really know what he's doing . There's no problem with post-production , however , as the cinematography is excellent and the way that the fight scenes are shot is good in that it allows them to be completely brutal , while never becoming completely exploitative . I read in British newspaper ' The Sun ' that 300 is ' the bloodiest movie in history ' , which of course isn't the case . There is a lot bloodshed , but it never really FEELS like there's a lot of bloodshed as the atmosphere is completely other-worldly . The way that Snyder uses his actors is good as the impressive Spartans add to the overall look of the film . The two central performances - those coming from Gerard Butler and the beautiful Lena Headey are both impressive , while the largely British support cast impress in their roles . Overall , this isn't a brilliant film as there are a lot of niggles ; but it has it's moments , and during the fight scenes ( which , thankfully , take up a large proportion of the film ) , you won't care about 300's shortfalls .
De Palma's Obsession	Brian De Palma has made a name for himself doing tributes to the great Alfred Hitchcock , and although this tribute is generally well liked amongst films fans ; it's not one of the better ones . What makes films like ' Dressed to Kill ' and ' Sisters ' great is that although De Palma has borrowed ( heavily ! ) from the master , he's always managed to take and yet create something fresh and inventive with it . Look at Dressed to Kill , for example ; the Psycho influences were more than obvious , but the film is so fresh and inventive that you would be forgiven for thinking that De Palma had made something on his own . Here , however , he's just took one of Vertigo's main plot details , and made a film out of it . The result is merely a film that is a rip off of Vertigo and not much else . The plot follows the story of Michael Courtland ; a man whose wife and child are killed during a botched kidnap rescue attempt . I don't really need to tell you what comes next if you've seen Vertigo , but I will anyway ; sixteen years later , he meets a woman that looks exactly like his wife and begins to develop an obsession with her . Who'd have thought it , eh ? The film is set in Italy , which gives it a very euro-horror feel , not too dissimilar to the masterpiece ; Don't Look Now . The atmosphere is actually one of the best things about the film , which is fairly sad in a movie that should be mostly story driven . Cliff Robertson takes the lead role , and plays it without much charisma . Of course , the character isn't very charismatic himself , but the performance is largely boring and I think that De Palma could have done a better job with the casting there . Starring alongside Robertson is Geneviève Bujold , and she isn't any better them him . Hers is another lackluster performance . The plotting of the film is another thing that isn't so good , especially when you consider that De Palma had a masterpiece of storytelling for his blueprint ( that's Vertigo , if you're not keeping up ) . Too much time is spent on the more boring things - such as an overly long romantic sequence , when De Palma would have been better off shortening it and spending more time building towards the twist . The twist itself is predictable when you've seen Vertigo , much like the rest of the film , but it would come as something of a surprise if you haven't . Overall , Obsession lacks freshness and only adds weight to the claim that De Palma is a pretentious plagiariser . However , there are some things to be liked about the film but a lot of them are lost if you have , like almost everyone else , seen Vertigo . And if you haven't seen Vertigo , you shouldn't see this as it will undoubtedly tarnish your first viewing of the aforementioned masterpiece . Obsession is decent enough entertainment to be enjoyed , but if you want to see De Palma do Hitchcock ; see Dressed to Kill , Sisters or the delirious campy Body Double and leave this to the die-hard De Palma fans .
Plenty going on , and there's not much violence . . . but it is set around a beach	Ernesto Gastaldi is best known as the writer of some of the greatest Giallo's ever made - and with classics such as Your Vice Is a Closed Room and Only I Have the Key , The Forbidden Photos of a Lady Above Suspicion and The Strange Vice of Mrs . Wardh on his writing resume , it's not hard to see why . However , he also directed a few films - this being one of them . The Lonely Violent Beach is nowhere near as good as the films previously mentioned ; but it represents a more than decent slice of Italian exploitation cinema , and it's made good by some interesting characters . The plot is pretty standard exploitation fare , and focuses on a married couple . It soon becomes obvious that the pair aren't happily married , and it turns out that they can't even have a happy weekend away , as their private party is soon crashed by a band of local bikers . The bikers tie up the bloke and the leader rapes his wife . The wife and the bike leader then fall for one another , and this is bad news for the husband ; and for the bike gang . . . The film isn't particularly violent - despite its title and the genre which it is a part of - and it's clear that Gastaldi was more keen to focus on the characters than merely violence . This is both good and bad ; on the one hand , it makes the film more interesting on an intellectual level and it makes it stand out more from the crowd of similar exploitation films . . . but on the other hand , you go into this sort of film with a certain set of expectations , and this one doesn't really live up to those expectations . The film is extremely rare , and so every copy available is likely to feature the same grainy picture that I had to put up with . I can't really see this one getting a decent DVD release either , due to its obscurity . The acting isn't too bad , although it's not exactly award worthy either . Gastaldi's direction is fine as he makes good use of the beach setting and builds the characters up well . There are no real surprises in the plot , and there's not a great deal of tension and suspense either , which renders it a bit flat . I liked this film , however , as it's different from most of its ilk , and I'd say it's just about worth seeing .
A brilliantly fun piece of trash !	Imagine Bonnie and Clyde without Clyde and with more of a trashy B-movie style to it , and you've got an idea of what Big Bad Mama is like . With Roger Corman on producing duty , you've to expect some silly trashy fun , and this film delivers that in droves as it's clear that nobody cared about making a credible film , which is usually good news for entertainment value . Angie Dickinson takes the lead role and makes good of it , as she carries the film with her engaging and enthusiastic performance . The film focuses on Dickinson's character Wilma , who decides to go into bootlegging when her lover is killed . Along with her two daughters , Wilma travels across the country and eventually meets a bank robber named Fred , and the pair decides to put their relative talents to good use in order to ' earn ' themselves some money . The support cast is good , with the likes of William Shatner , Dick Miller and Tom Skerritt being put to good use , while lesser known performers such as Robbie Lee and Susan Sennett also giving entertaining turns . The reason this film works so well is undoubtedly down to director Steve Carver's focus on entertaining his audience . This does leave it feeling more than a little bit empty , but in a film where bank robberies , sex scenes , car chases and more feature heavily , this isn't a big problem . Overall , if you fancy a fun filled eighty minutes or so - you could certainly do a lot worse than this little flick !
Decent and different Eurocrime entry	The Poliziotteschi genre is mostly populated by maverick cops and sadistic criminals ; so The New Godfathers is something of an original addition to the genre . As the Italian title suggests ; this film focuses on contraband - which a popular focus for this genre , but rather than focus on one side of the war ; the film is instead bolstered by a working relationship between a customs officer and a top criminal as they work together for mutual gain . It has to be said that the film has some problems in terms of plot pacing and it's not exactly a thrill a minute ; but some good characters and interesting plot development at least ensures that the film remains decent for the running time . The New Godfathers begins with a heroin shipment in Iran being halted by a revolution . Naturally there's people intent on getting this heroin to the USA ; and so decide to run it through a small group of smugglers in Italy . However , Italian customs get wind of what is going on and seek to strike a bargain with the local criminals . The most interesting parts of the film focus on Naples ' smuggler community and thankfully director Alfonso Brescia ( who previously directed the disappointing Giallo Naked Girl Killed in the Park ) spends a lot of time on this element . There's also a subplot involving two young kids in love that works better than it really had any right to . This genre is usually bolstered by high speed car chases and gunfights ; although this one doesn't feature as much of that as other genres , which is disappointing ; although it made up for by some superior characters and acting . The cast is lead by the pairing of Mario Merola and Antonio Sabato , who will both be familiar to Eurocrime fans ; having starred in a number of these films between them . The second half of the film is more action packed than the first and the move towards the story's conclusion is carried off with style and verve ; although the final sequences could have been better edited . Overall , I wouldn't exactly say that this film is at the pinnacle of its genre ; but it's a more than decent watch and Eurocrime fans should give it a look .
Confusing stuff ! But it's not bad .	Eye in the Labyrinth is not your average Giallo . . . and to be honest , I'm not really sure that it really is a Giallo ; but Giallo or not , despite some problems , this is certainly a very interesting little film . I'm hesitant to call it a Giallo because the film doesn't feature most of the things that make these films what they are ; but many genre entries break the mould , and this would seem to be one of them . The film doesn't feature any brutal murders as many Giallo's do , but this is made up for with a surreal atmosphere and a plot just about confusing enough to remain interesting for the duration . The plot seems simple enough in that it focuses on a doctor who is murdered by Julie , his patient who , for some reason , she sees him as her lover and father and is offended when he walks out on her . We then relocate to a big house lived in by a number of people , but nothing is really what it seems as there are a number of secrets surrounding various events that happened before Julie's arrival . . . The film seems to be professing something about how the mind is like a labyrinth . This never really comes off , and I preferred to just sit back and enjoy what was going on rather than worrying about what point ( if any ) the film is trying to make . Eye in the Labyrinth is directed by Mario Caiano , the director behind the excellent Night of the Doomed some years earlier . He doesn't create the atmosphere as well in this film as he did in the earlier one ; but the surreal aspects of the story come off well , and the mystery is always kept up which stops the film from becoming boring . The film stars Rosemary Dexter , who provides eye candy throughout and also delivers a good performance . Most of the rest of the cast aren't really worth mentioning , with the exceptions of Adolfo Celi , who is good as the villain of the piece and Alida Valli , whom cult fans will remember from a whole host of excellent cult flicks . The film does explain itself at the end ; which is lucky as I'm sure I'm not the only viewer who was more than a little confused by then ! Overall , this may not be classic stuff ; but its good enough and worth seeing .
Not a return to form for the Italian Hitchcock , but a good tribute to the master	Being a massive fan of Dario Argento , the release of a new Argento film is always an event as far as I'm concerned , and even though this made for TV movie is far from the director's best work ; it's a well orchestrated Giallo-style tribute to the great Alfred Hitchcock , and is well worth seeing for both fans of Argento and fans of Hitchcock . The film takes inspiration from across Hitchcock's filmography , and includes heavy handed ' tributes ' to the likes of Rear Window , Dial ' M ' for Murder and Strangers on a Train , as well as smaller nods to the likes of Psycho . The script is good in that it manages to take in all of these elements , and yet still turn out a mostly fresh-feeling story . The plot centres on Giulio - a film student and a big fan of Hitchcock . He lives opposite a sexy young woman and her mother , whom he constantly witnesses arguing with one another . When the mother is murdered , he becomes obsessed with figuring out who did it - especially since he heard his neighbour and another young woman discussing Strangers on a Train in the local video shop . Does Hitchcock's influence extend to this murder ? The first thing I noticed about this film was the rather awkward dialogue , which seems to taint many films of this kind . This shame aside , the thriller aspects of the movie work really well and Argento has lost none of his ability to create suspense . The film gets better as it goes along , and Argento adds in several well worked sequences that really have the ability to get the audience on the edge of their seats . Scenes involving a bathtub , a motorcycle and a Rear Window style climax make up the best of the suspense moments . There isn't as much gore in this film as there has been in previous Argento instalments - a shame , but the TV origins of the film would obviously have restrained the director , and there is a rather bloody murder sequence towards the start . I have to admit that I didn't like the main character very much , and the acting isn't all that good all round ; with only the female talent making any kind of impression ; and that's not because of their acting . Overall , this is hardly a return to form for Argento , but it's a lot better than The Card Player and is still a film well worth seeing .
Lovely adventure yarn from Hammer studios !	Hammer are famous for making horror movies ( obviously ) , and ' She ' is often considered amongst Hammer's horror offerings . I beg to differ from that notion , as although it certainly has horror elements : this is most definitely an adventure movie . Still , the delirious Hammer style is definitely still there and this movie succeeds in conforming to the camp ideals that Hammer became famous for ( and that I love them for ! ) . This is also one of many ( though not enough ! ) movies to feature the immense talents of both of Hammer's super-heavyweights ; Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee , and both deliver to their regular high standard . The plot follows three men who travel to a lost city in search of riches that have been promised to them upon their arrival . However , the city is ruled by the powerful ' She who must be obeyed ' ( Ursula Andress ) and she believes one of the men to be her reincarnated love , so sets about making him conform to her way of thinking . . . The film exudes a sense of sleaze , in spite of not being essentially sleazy . This has come about due to the central theme of the woman being the dominant party , and as the woman in question is played by the domineering Ursula Andress , that sense is exuded quite plainly . Also joining in the fun aside from Cushing , Lee and Andress is Hammer favourite André Morell , who completes a rather fine cast . The low budget is more than obvious on a number of occasions , mostly through the cheap looking sets , and it seems as if the producers have been a little over ambitious . It doesn't matter , though , as the low budget adds to the charm and appeal of the movie , which ensures that the movie is even more fun for the viewer . The moral to the story has some credibility too , and the ending actually succeeds in being fairly powerful . On the whole , ' She ' isn't a prime example of how great the adventure genre can be ; but it's a solid film , and fans of low budget kitsch will find something to like .
Brilliant claustrophobic tale of paranoia !	I can't say I'm a big fan of The Twilight Zone ; I used to watch it now and again as a kid but , to be honest , I've forgotten most of what I've seen . I've just seen this episode , however , and have just had a stark reminder of how good these twenty five minute episodes of terror can be ! Nightmare at 20 , 000 feet is one of the most famous episodes of The Twilight Zone , partly because of the excellent Simpsons ' parody of it . We follow an aeroplane passenger who has recently been the victim of a nervous breakdown . Upon peering out of the window , he spots a gremlin trying to take the plane apart - only problem is , it disappears whenever anyone else looks out ; and nobody is willing to take his word for it ! The reason why this little tale is so good is because of the way it draws us into the lead character's plight ; this really is an impossible situation , and watching him get out of it is lots of fun , and often very funny ! Almost the entire episode is set inside of an aeroplane , which gives the tale a very claustrophobic feel , which in turn helps it to be more frightening . This episode stars future Captain Kirk , William Shatner - who does a fine job as the paranoid lead , and an interesting little bit of trivia , is that it's directed by Lethal Weapon director Richard Donner . I cant say how this episode stands up to the best of the rest of The Twilight Zone - but in it's own right ; it's damn good , and miles better than most of the rubbish they put on TV these days . Highly recommended viewing !
Batman ; resurrected	It's about time that comic book movies started being taken seriously . We've had a surge of good ones recently - Spider-Man , X-Men and Sin City to name a handful , and not only are these movies entertaining and visually stunning , their drama aspects are spot on also ; making these films a complete package . Batman Begins is no different , and the film marks another huge success for the comic book film sub-genre . Rather than delving straight into the action as previous Batman films have done , director Christopher Nolan has decided to take us back to the origins of the caped crusader , and therefore plugging us into his plight before dishing up some very spectacular action sequences . Needless to say , this does the film no end of favours because we actually CARE about what happens to our hero , rather than just rooting for him because he's the protagonist . The acclaimed director of ' Memento ' also shows us the difference between himself and how a hack would handle the story by not overpowering the movie with action sequences , and making the drama behind the story arguably even more interesting than Batman's high-octane antics . I didn't go into Batman Begins expecting to be emotionally affected , but the movie surprises in that respect as well . The scenes that show us how Bruce Wayne made the decision to devote his life to fighting crime are genuinely touching , and add massive emotional weight to Bruce Wayne's back story . This is offset by the action sequences , which are extremely well orchestrated and show us that the director can do action as well as drama . The way that the action is held back ( it's an hour into the film before ' Batman ' even appears ) helps rather than hinders the scenes themselves as they mean more by the time they do appear , which shows us Nolan's skill as a director . The man has also put together an astounding cast of actors to tell his story . Christian Bale , who is the absolute perfect choice for the title role , heads an all-star cast , which includes Gary Oldman , Liam Neeson , Katie Holmes , Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine , to name a few . Bale captures just the right amount of darkness and strength for his character and I wouldn't hesitate to name him as the best man to ever don the black cape . Nolan shows his adeptness again by the way he handles his lead actor , which is shown best by the ' American Psycho ' style scene in a high class restaurant . Gotham city is just another masterstroke in this movie , and unlike previous Batman offerings ; the city is much more realistic this time round . It still holds that classic Gothic metropolitan feel ; but the way it's shot is much more down to Earth , and Nolan has given us a realistic world for his unrealistic story . The story itself compliments this new landscape for the series excellently , and it's much more subtle than what previous Batman films have offered us . We deal with the idea of ' fear ' , and the main villain ; The Scarecrow is the perfect choice for the villain of the piece . The special effects in the movie are continually astounding , and everything from the way that The Scarecrow taps into his victim's fears to the huge chase sequences in the film look and feel just like they've been taken from a comic book . This is the sort of movie that reminds movie fans exactly why they're movie fans ; and in this respect , the film is spectacular throughout . On the whole , this film is further proof that comic books can be the source of movies that are just as credible as the dramas that take the gold come awards season . Batman Begins is more than just a movie about a man in a cape who fights crime ; it's an emotional ride into his inner psyche and , of course , it's also a lot of fun . Nolan has captured just the right balance between action and drama and I say roll on the sequel !
Perfection isn't always perfect	The Lateness of the Hour represents another sterling success for The Twilight Zone ! The plot idea behind this episode has been used many times since , and it follows the idea of perfection . We are acquainted with a family ; mother , father , daughter and servants . However , the daughter has become bored with their existence . The family lives in the perfect environment , with no contact with the outside world ; and she craves more . More than what her parents and the servants can give her ? The brains of this tale make up its backbone . I love the way that the writers can take twenty five minute of screen time and give you a tale that makes you think more than most feature films do ! The way that the story takes place in what seems like a whole other world ensures that it very much feels like a part of The Twilight Zone . All the trademarks of the show ; from the over the top music score , to Rod Serling making an appearance to add in important plot details every now again feature , and I've got to say that this is one of the most ingenious episodes of the classic TV show that I've seen yet ! Highly recommended like all the other episodes .
More of that Southern hospitality . . .	HG Lewis ' gore classic Two Thousand Maniacs isn't the obvious choice for the remake treatment , but surprisingly enough it got one - and it's pretty damn good ! Actually , I'd say that this film is more of a sequel than a remake , as it takes in the same basic plot idea as the sixties splatterfest , but other than that the film is mostly new . And besides , the Godfather of Gore did promise us that the South was going to rise again . The film takes in many of Lewis ' trademarks ; from over the top silly gore , to a great streak of black humour . The Southern swing has been retained too , and we get treated to all manner of weird Redneck traits - best of all being the pair of minstrels that pop up every now and again to sing us a song ! As mentioned , the basic plot remains the same and follows a bunch of young kids who end up in the strange town of Pleasant Valley after taking several detours . They arrive just as the town is about to take up it's Jubilee celebrations , and believe it or not ; the teenagers become the guests of honour ! However , they end up being offered more than just free beer . . . The fact that the film features the questionable talents of a bunch of young actors will no doubt annoy fans of the original , as it could easily be taken that the film is taking in too many of modern horror's traits . However , I disagree ; the young cast do well in their respective roles , and the characters are generally quite easy to like . It's the older cast members that really make the movie stand out , however , and it's obvious that Robert Englund had a good time playing the central role he has in this film . He is joined by prolific actress Lin Shaye , who also does well as his opposite number . Obviously , the most important thing about this film is the gore - and in true HG Lewis fashion , it's amazingly over the top ! We've got acid , limb-tearing , eye popping , a nasty little scene involving metal teeth and more ! The gore is hard to take seriously . . . and HG fans will know why that's a good thing . It has to be said that the film is a little messy , but it doesn't matter because it's a constant stream of entertainment . If we're not witnessing a bloody death scene , there's always plenty of naked chicks and Southern ' hospitality ' on hand to keep the film fun . Overall , I recommend this film .
Eastwood triumphs yet again	Usually when the latest ' big thing ' gets released , I go to cinema and end up disappointed . With Million Dollar Baby , however ; that was not the case . Clint Eastwood's latest film is a powerful blend of believable characters and raw , gritty realism . The film benefits from Clint Eastwood's assured , no frills directing style immensely as it gives the film it's potent edge , and the lack of trickery ensures that our attention is never distracted from the characters and storyline . Clint spends the first twenty minutes of the movie setting the scene , which therefore allows the audience to get to know the score , before taking us on an emotional and physical roller-coaster ride through a myriad of emotions . This allows Eastwood to play with his viewer's emotions without the necessity to concentrate on the central theme of boxing - and Million Dollar Baby is all the better a film for it . Clint Eastwood made a name for himself by playing a character that you cant possibly disagree with . In movies like Sergio Leone's ' Dollar ' trilogy , down to his own films , such as High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven ; we are with Clint every step of the way , no matter what evil deeds he's doing . He perfected the anti-hero and proved that an audience can be fully behind any character . For this movie , Clint has given himself a support role , and all the faith that we would usually put him has been transferred to Hilary Swank . Hilary Swank is absolutely perfect in this movie , and anyone that says otherwise is sadly mistaken . She approaches her role with all the determination that epitomises her character on screen , and delivers a fine performance with it . Emotionally as well as physically , Swank never gives us a reason to doubt that she is Maggie Fitzgerald ; the character she plays on screen . If Swank doesn't walk away with the Best Actress award for 2004 , there is something seriously wrong . Despite taking a back step , Eastwood still manages to retain that which he made his name with . Once again , Eastwood is the downbeat loner - the man who comes along and changes thing ; the catalyst of the story . This performance is much more mature than the work Eastwood did in his earlier movies , and may well go on to represent the twilight years of this classic actor . The way that Eastwood gets the audience behind his central character is simply breathtaking . During the boxing scenes especially , Clint's subdued style lends them a potent realism and the audience feels every punch thrown and every wound endured . The boxing scenes are also testament to Eastwood's triumph with characterisation as well as technical potency , as we follow Maggie Fitzgerald every step of the way . When she takes a punch , we feel it too and when she delivers a blow - the audience is able to feel the adrenaline pumping , the same as the character does on screen . It's one of the hardest things to make an audience feel for a character , but Million Dollar Baby , not satisfied with just making us feel ? allows us to become one with the emotions on screen . However , all is not rosy in the almost perfect garden that Eastwood has created . Basically , it's the musical score . Million Dollar Baby is a powerful film , and just the images and dialogue alone is enough to convey the story to the audience and make them feel for the characters - but for some reason , many scenes are saturated in a horrible rural style beat and it doesn't do the film any favours at all . Music almost always adds to the images on screen , but sometimes no music is better . I almost feel like I'm nitpicking as the film is so close to perfection , but it's a niggling little aspect of it that annoyed me . Million Dollar Baby is not one of those films that comes along and changes the cinematic landscape . However , it's a powerful drama with some excellent acting , great direction and a brilliant storyline . I'm not a boxing fan , but when it comes to films like this ; it doesn't matter what you like . Usually when I go to the cinema , there's a mad rush to the doors at the end ? no matter what the film ? but this wasn't the case with Million Dollar Baby . Everyone in the cinema sat in their seats until the end credits rolled , and although I cant speak for everyone ; I did so because the film is so utterly spellbinding and I needed the time for the credits to roll to catch my breath . I don't need to say this but I will : see this movie .
Horribly captivating	Irreversible is a thoroughly unpleasant cinematic experience . It clearly knows this , and is keen to revel in it as the disorientating camera angles and monotonous tones of the soundtrack in the early moments of the film show . In fact , Irreversible appears to be on a mission to be as horrible and as nasty as it can possibly be and the result is a truly powerful film experience . After a lovely little epilogue to Gaspar Noé's earlier film , I Stand Alone , we are taken on a thriller ride through gay clubs and the underworld of France as our hero sets out for retribution after his girlfriend was raped and beaten by an unknown assailant . This isn't all , however , as the film professes that " time destroys everything " and to portray that , the events are shown in reverse order . This is clearly a result of Memento's influence on modern cinema , and it bodes really well in this film as the fact that the events are ' irreversible ' would not have been able to be shown so destructively if the film followed the usual storytelling methods . Some people will come out of Irreversible asking themselves what it is that they've seen , why they watched it and why they feel guilty about watching it - and this is why Irreversible is so powerful . Cinema can have a profound effect on it's viewer , and Irreversible is one of the most adept films at showing this . During the film , we witness a man having his head caved in ( literally ) with a fire extinguisher , various perverted acts and , of course , the infamous rape scene involving Monica Bellucci . This scene is not a scene to be enjoyed , but at the same time it's utterly captivating ? and despite the fact that it lasts over ten minutes and is thoroughly unpleasant , we don't notice and what Gaspar Noé has created is , in essence a train wreck - it's horrible , but at the same time we cant take our eyes away from it . This shows what a visual talent Noé is , as , for one , few filmmakers would dare to implement a sequence such as this in their film , and many wouldn't have the talent to portray it as horribly and intriguingly as he does here . Make no mistake , this film is not one for the faint hearted - but at the same time , it stays with you and it's not an experience you are likely to forget . Which makes it must see .
Post-apocalypse , with a smile	The Last Man on Earth gets an eighties update for this delightful little flick . Night of the Comet mixes Sci-Fi with horror and comedy , while finding time to take a swipe at American life , pop culture and , of course , the B-movie classics of the 1950's . The film isn't very coherent , and constantly switches tones to suit whatever mood the plot takes on ; but it doesn't matter , because this type of post-apocalyptic plot is always fascinating , and Night of the Comet always makes the best of it . The film does carry a very jokey tone throughout , and even though the plot follows the serious theme of everyone on the planet being wiped out ; it does it with a smile on its face . The main body of the plot follows two sisters ; Samantha and Regina Belmont , who wake up one morning to find to that last night's comet has turned almost everyone into dust . However , they soon find out that they aren't the only ones left ; as they meet a truck driver , some scientists holed up in an underground lab and , unfortunately for them , a bunch of zombies ! The film has a very cheap feel throughout ; so cheap , in fact , that at some points it actually reverts to animation to show certain things . It doesn't matter , though , because watching this film gives you same impression that the B-movie classics of the fifties do ; you really feel like the filmmakers have made the best of the low budget . The script is well written and while , at times , it feels as though it's suffering from a lack of ideas , generally the story moves well and the parodies that the film presents come across well . The acting is nothing to write home , but all the cast deliver decent performances and obviously enjoyed themselves . Catherine Mary Stewart gives a portrayal of your typical eighties teen flick female lead , while Kelli Maroney ( Chopping Mall ) is the typical bimbo cheerleader , in the role of her sister . The style of the film is very much eighties ; and the tacky soundtrack does well in instilling this with the audience . Overall , Night of the Comet is well worth seeing . While it's not always coherent , the film makes up for it with its vitality and the way it captures the eighties . Recommended !
Brilliantly absurd low budget black comedy !	It's clear right from the beginning that Eating Raoul isn't a ' good ' film ; the picture looks trashy , the acting leaves a lot to be desired and there's a very ' low quality ' feel running throughout . However , the film conquers all these problems with two things ; a very amusing and inventive plot line , and a delightful style , which , once the movie gets into its stride , ensures that it's going to be a fun ride throughout . The film is very much of a non-politically correct attitude , so you can expect an indifferent view to socially unacceptable actions , such as murder . Just the fact that all the said crimes are casually perpetrated with a frying pan shows that ! The plot follows a ' square ' couple living in Los Angeles . They want to buy a restaurant , but they're struggling to make ends meet presently . However , after the accidental murder of a neighbour ; the pair gets the bright idea to kill people for their money . The swingers living in their hotel are providing a nuisance to them , so they're the obvious targets for murder . . . but things go awry when a burglar named Raoul gets in on the plot . What makes this film work is the plotting , purely and simply . The way that the plot moves is great because you never know where the film is going next , and there are always plenty of gags on hand to make the film a little more fun . The comedy is definitely of the ' black ' variety - and that's always been my favourite kind . The acting isn't great , but the cast do well in their respective roles ; and it's obvious that all concerned enjoyed working on this movie . Writer-director Paul Bartel was a busy guy , as he also takes the lead role . Joining him is cult actress Mary Woronov in the role of his wife , while Robert Beltran rounds off the central threesome . Many of the gags in the movie come from the idea of such a ' bland ' couple involving themselves in the world of kinky fetishes , but the film also finds time for some slapstick and a lot of sharp wit . The scenes that see certain ' swingers ' acting out their fantasies are generally very funny , and I don't hesitate to name Eating Raoul as one of the most surprisingly brilliant black comedies I've ever seen . It may be cheap and a bit nasty . . . but Paul Bertel's film is a gem that every cult fan must see !
Gritty and gruesome . . . excellent !	Mark of the Devil is a German horror film from the 1970's . It stars Udo Kier and Herbert Lomm , features bucket loads of gore and more grisly torture sequences than you can shake a barb wired stick at . Adding to that is the fact that it tackles the subject of witch hunting and what you have is a film that has the title ' cult classic ' written all over it ! Michael Armstrong's film isn't the usual kind of witch hunting movie , however , as rather than portraying the witch hunting and torture sequences purely for the sake of horror , the film depicts the debauchery and hypocrisy of the witch hunts that took place around the time that this film is set . The fact that it takes that theme and mixes it with lots of gore makes the film all the better , as a film with just one or the other may have been either boring , or putridly pointless ; but this film does both and therefore works on more than one level . The torture sequences in the movie are some of the bloodiest and most cringe-worthy ever committed to the screen , and even I , a hardened gore fan , had to look away at numerous times . The violence is very realistic , which makes it all the more shocking and potent as it's easy to believe that the people you are watching having their tongues cut out really are having their tongues cut out . Mark of the Devil also features strong western undertones , which is always nice to see in a horror movie if you ask me . The music doesn't really do the movie any favours as it's rather silly and a foreboding score would have served the film better . The score that the film has only serves in undoing the tension in the scenes it features in . Udo Kier and Herbert Lomm have both cemented themselves as icons within the realms of the cult horror film and both do themselves proud in this movie . Of course , the amazingly awful dubbing brings the film down in every respect , so it's probably better if you can get your hands on a subtitled copy ; but otherwise this is very much recommended viewing !
Stuart Gordon does HP Lovecraft , with great results again !	From almost the same team that brought us the classic horror Re-Animator sixteen years previously , comes this HP Lovecraft-adapted flick . We've got Stuart Gordon in the director's chair and Brian Yuzna producing , leaving out only cult star Jeffrey Combs . . . who would , actually , have made a great lead ; but never mind . Based on the short stories ' Dagon ' and ' The Shadow Over Innsmouth ' , Dagon has Lovecraft written all over it and follows a fishing village by the name of Imboca . In return for fish and gold , the locals there have taken to worshipping the deity ' Dagon ' . However , this has taken its toll ; as the locals now exist in the form of deformed fish-men ! That's what I love about Lovecraft , he always finds time for deformities and monsters in his stories - which almost always ensures that they're more frightening than most . We follow Paul ; a young man who , along with his friends , become shipwrecked near to Imboca . After venturing to the village in search of a phone and his girlfriend , our hero finds himself trapped and about to be sacrificed to the villager's god ! Dagon is a really good film , and certainly one of the best of this decade ; but despite the talented people behind it , it's still not quite great . The acting is a major letdown , with Ezra Godden doing his best Jeffrey Combs impression ; but personally , I'd rather have seen the man himself . Francisco Rabal died shortly after the release of this film , which is a shame ; but he doesn't have enough screen time to make a lasting impression . The rest of the cast drowns the film where the acting is concerned . It's also rather badly plotted , and gets off to a very slow start ; which is liable to turn some viewers off immediately . Once it gets going , however , it really gets going ; and by then , the acting and plotting don't matter , as it's the special effects and invention that become the stars of the show . The effects look like they should look rubbish , but they really don't . The fish-people actually look good ! The gore is ample , but never gratuitous and the imagination behind the story is immense , and could only have come from the mind of one of the horror genre's great masters . This is no Re-Animator ; but it's a more than decent example of the fact that good horror is still being made !
Big and bold . . . but slightly too big	Usually I start off reviews of remakes by saying that the original doesn't need a new version ; but although the original King Kong is one of my favourite movies of all time , I'm not going to say that it doesn't need an update with this review . While I love the classic version of the film ; I do concede that it isn't easily accessible for a modern audience ( black and white . . . ) , and as the story is nothing less than brilliant ; it isn't a bad thing that it is being re-released upon a more modern audience . The fact that director Peter Jackson has largely kept faithful to the original film , despite an army of computers definitely works in the film's favour also . Going into the film , I was worried that Jackson's three hour running time might be a problem ; but it doesn't harm the film at all . Many of the sequences go on a bit too long , and Jackson could definitely have benefited from some tighter editing ; but in general , the additional running time isn't a problem at all , as a lot of the time is spent on building characters and setting up the central locations , which pays dividends once we get down to the final act . The film is divided into three clear sections ; the first of which is set in New York , and sees the characters getting themselves into the situation that will eventually lead them to Skull Island and the monster that inhabits it . The second of the two sections takes place on the island itself , and we finish off back in New York as the story reaches its potent , thrilling and heartbreaking conclusion . As you would expect from modern cinema , the special effects are state of the art ; and they are obviously one of the most important aspects of the film for director Peter Jackson . Quite clearly not as important as the central romance between theatre actress and giant ape ; but the fact that the film is packed with lavish effects sequences shows that it's an important aspect . They are , at the end of the day , the reason that this story is being remade now . King Kong himself looks wonderful , but , ironically , is much better in the close-up shots than the action scenes . The rest of the monsters , from Tyrannosaurs to enormous insects , look great also ; but somehow just can't compare to the stop motion puppets of the original . When watching King Kong 1933 , you really feel like you're seeing something audiences would have stared at in wonder at the time ; but while the effects here are good , by now ; we've seen it all before . CGI looks too effortless to be impressive in the same way that effects were back in 1933 . Remaking King Kong was a dream for Peter Jackson ( I wish someone would give me excess of 200 million dollars to realise my dream ! ) and it's obvious that it's the central romance that interests him the most . While the affection given to Fay Wray in the original was always unwelcome , Naomi Watts embraces it , and the result is a much more heartbreaking tragedy than what was seen in the original film . The expressions on the monkey say it all , and I dare say that more than a few audience members will be reduced to tears watching King Kong . The way that it's paralleled with the theme of the King of the jungle being taken from his habitat for profit reasons adds to the effect , and Jackson continually shows this by breaking up Watts ' and Kong's scenes with showers of bullets and man made attacks on the beast . The three leads help to make the story what it is , with the excellent Jack Black excelling as the director with a one-track mind ; and Adrien Brody showing that he can be the action hero in a role that sees him cast against type . It is Watts that takes the film's most important role however ; and while she gets more to do than Fay Wray did seven decades earlier ; she just doesn't do it so well . The actress wears her emotions on her sleeve , and we are never in any doubt as to what she's feeling . This isn't a terribly bad thing ; but if a little more was left to the imagination , the relationship between woman and monkey would have come off as being much more believable . King Kong 2005 was unlikely to ever gain as much praise as the original monster movie did ; but this is still well worth seeing , and the fact that the director obviously cares about the original movie ensures that this film stands out among remakes . The two central locations have been lovingly recreated , and this film is worth seeing both for the Beauty and the Beast plot line , and the nostalgia that seeing 1930's New York on screen in 2005 will have for many viewers . I can't say this is as great as the original film ( because it's not ) , but it's well worth seeing ; and I'd rewatch this before the Lord of the Rings trilogy any day of the week . Well , unless I'd been watching this film on repeat all week . . . then I'd probably choose Lord of the Rings .
One of cinema's finest achievements	Odd Man Out is a terrific piece of cinema . It is set in Ireland and stars James Mason as Johnny McQueen ; leader of an underground Irish organization that engage in a robbery that will enable the organisation to steal the funds it needs to continue it's activities . However , the heist goes sour . Events conspire against him , and Johnny ends up wounded and alone in the city of Belfast . The police then launch a huge manhunt to find the criminal and lead him to justice , and what follows is a desperate struggle by Johnny , and Johnny's friends , to get him to safety . Before the film starts , it claims that it is not about the state of Ireland at that time , but rather the effect that the state of the country has had on it's people ; and that is exactly what the film does . The neutral people in the film are caught between whose side to be on ; helping the police will keep them out of jail , and for some , make them feel like they are doing the right thing ; but nobody wants to get on the wrong side of Johnny's " organisation " , as that could also be detrimental to your survival . All of the characters in the film have some affiliation to the state , be it good for them or , more commonly , bad for them . Odd Man Out is an adventure . It's an adventure about one man's struggle to get from point A to point B . Like all good adventure films , he meets people along the way ; some that will help him , some that won't . It's exciting in this respect , but the film isn't only an adventure . As he did in his other masterpiece ; The Third Man , Carol Reed succeeds in giving a thriller a great substance . That's one of things that's great about this film ; on the surface , it's entertaining and therefore can be enjoyed by anyone , but if you take a look under it's skin , the film has depth also ; which firmly places it in the " film buff " category of films . Odd Man Out clearly highlights the paranoia , values and fears of the era , and these are explored through the main character . Odd Man Out is one of the best directed films that I've ever seen . Carol Reed is an excellent director , and one who is worthy of more acclaim . Here , he indulges in many tricks with the camera , including a terrific sequence that sees our hero see multiple images in a puddle of spilled beer . Reed pulls all of these tricks off , and none look out of place . Considering that this movie was made in 1947 , it's a piece of technical wizardry . Reed also uses many different cinema styles at different times to further his story . The film is dramatic at certain points where the characters are interacting , but at the other end of the spectrum ; it's very cinematic at certain times , most notably in the scenes that see Johnny being chased through the streets of Belfast . These scenes are extremely atmospheric and very aesthetically pleasing . Despite indulging in many different tricks and styles ; the film is never gratuitous . Where another , lesser , director might have gone over the top ; Reed doesn't , and it keeps the film very much on the level , which is to his , and this piece of art's credit . Overall , Odd Man Out is a masterpiece that is on par with , if not better than The Third Man . It's a shame that it has seemingly been forgotten as this movie can surely take it's place among the best of all time . A glorious must see .
Foreboding mood and ingenious direction ? It's just another Mario Bava horror masterclass !	This often overlooked Bava highlight is reminiscent of the hammer horror films of the 60's and 70's . The film follows the story of a cursed village in which people are dying . A doctor has been called into the village to do an autopsy on some of the local people that have been murdered mysteriously . While there , he is continually told of the curse and other superstitions , of which , naturally , he believes none of . He soon finds out that it is the dead daughter of a local Baroness that is doing the killings to collect the souls of the villagers . Will the doctor and the local sorceress be able to save the village before it's too late ? As usual with the overly talented , yet unfairly ignored Mario Bava : through it's Gothic style , this film breathes an atmosphere as thick as blood . Some of the settings , most notably those of the houses of the inhabitants are absolutely delicious . The film also features Bava's trademark use of lighting to create the aforementioned foreboding atmosphere , and it is at it's best in this movie . There is also a great sequence that seems to have taken it's influence from Vertigo , where Bava directs our attention down a spiral staircase . The way that the village is coated in thick smoke also partly gives the film it's atmosphere . Bava is a very intricate and ingenious director and multiple mood creators are one way of showing his dedication to his films . The film also features more than it's fair share of macabre sequences , especially given it's year of release . We've got someone cutting their throat with a sickle , someone pushing a spike into their chest and lots more enjoyable scenes of torture . On the story and acting side . . . this film does fall down a little . The acting is a mixed bag ; some of it is good , others are decent but some are really bad . It's hard to tell bad acting through bad dubbing , so some actors can be let off however . The story does get a little muddled at times , which can leave some viewers cold . Italian horror isn't known for it's dedication to keeping it's plots coherent , however ; so people going in to this movie can expect to get a little confused . Always , though , even if the story is muddled ; Bava's brilliant direction is always enough to keep you entertained . Also worth mentioning is it's title ; " Kill , Baby . . . Kill ! " . Some people seem to be complaining about it being a silly title - I couldn't disagree more ! It's an ingenious title ; Bava has several titles , " Hatchet for the Honeymoon " , " Baron Blood " and " Danger : Diabolik " being just three of them ; but the one here stands out as the best in my opinion . Overall ; Kill , Baby . . . Kill ! is a great horror film , with a great title and should not be missed by any fan of the genre . It is true that this isn't Bava's best film , but it stands up there as one of the best . A Bava film is always worth seeing , if for the atmosphere and direction alone .
The evil that people do	Jean Renoir will always be best remembered for his prisoner of war film , La Grande Illusion , but if you ask me ; this film is better . Based on a book by Émile Zola , The Human Beast tells of the horrible things that humans can do , and follows the story of Severine and her husband Rouband , who kill a man on a train . A train engineer by the name of Jacques spies upon them , and not only does this man not turn the couple in ; he falls in love with Severine . The film plays out much a like an entry from the film noir style that was popular in the forties and fifties . The dark tone and the story , which deals with atrocities , gives the film that feel and as a fan of film noir ; I found this pleasing . Nobody in the cast stands out above the rest really , but nobody can be singled out for not delivering a fine performance either ; and the ensemble comes together well on the whole in that respect . It's evident that this film was made only shortly after the silent film era , as the music is overdone and , at times , undermines the dialogue in certain scenes . Jean Renoir deserves the title of one of the best French directors ever to grace the director's chair as his direction is superb and his list of directorial credits echoes this fact . On the whole , The Human Beast is a quality dark drama and I highly recommend it to fans of French cinema .
Bizarre mix of humour and lunacy !	What we have here is a bizarre mix of psycho horror and pitch black comedy that actually works much better than I thought it would . The film is based on a stage play by Maisie Mosco and follows a so-called ' happy family ' who all happen to be lunatics . The film is directed by Freddie Francis who of course has a lot of experience in directing cult and horror movies having done a number of films for Hammer Horror and numerous other projects . The film is not very well known and was considered lost for a number of years . I have to say that doesn't really surprise me - this flick is a bit too weird to have a great deal of mass market appeal ! The plot focuses on a family made up of four people - unsurprisingly calling themselves ; Mumsy , Nanny , Sonny and Girly . This clan has a habit of kidnapping people , subjecting them to torturous games for a little while and then " sending them to the angels " once bored of them . This all goes well until they kidnap a New Friend , who is not happy to join in with the games and decides to play some of his own . . . The film is very ' British ' in style and execution and Freddie Francis does well in elevating the film away from it's stage play origins - although it's still clear that this story was originally a play from the settings and the way most of the scenes play out . Almost the entire film takes place in and around the large house that is the living area of the central characters . The lack in variation for locations doesn't harm the film however as the house matches the plot brilliantly and the way that it all takes place around one area helps to enforce the unfortunate kidnapped characters ' situations and lack of escape routes . The acting is spot on , with all four of the title characters being brought to life convincingly - Vanessa Howard is particularly good as the mischievous ' Girly ' . Michael Bryant is probably the best known member of the cast and he fits in well with the rest of them . The humour on display is so black that a lot of it will be missed - I have to say that I didn't find the film particularly ' funny ' myself . Still , this is an excellent slice of cult cinema and well worth seeing if you can get your hands on a copy !
Stunning Italian crime flick !	My interest in Italian cinema is usually limited to horror films , but I made an exception for this crime flick - and I'm certainly glad that I did ! Actually , The Big Racket isn't a world away from the popular Italian Giallo styling , only instead of having a vicious murderer on the loose ; we have a small town at the mercy of a group of organised thugs . For a film with this sort of plot , it's surprising just how good The Big Racket is . Italian films from the seventies have a bad reputation for not making a lot of sense , but not only does this one make sense - it benefits from a great , multi-angled story as well . The film sees a bunch of criminals sabotaging local businesses and asking for protection money from the owners to make them stop . The police presence in the town is largely ineffective , with the exception of one man - Inspector Nico Palmieri . Of course , you can't go around intimidating people and destroying their property for long before someone is going to fight back - and as the justice system isn't working , our hero has to find other ways to bring law and order back to his town . The Big Racket benefits immensely from a strong leading performance courtesy of Fabio Testi ( star of What Have They Done to Solange ) . Testi's portrayal of the angry police officer is perfectly judged to fit the movie , and I don't think there is an actor who could be better suited to playing the lead in this movie . He heads a strong Italian cast , who all do well in bringing their characters to life , as well as providing the movie with the Italian style that it revels in . The script is really good , and finds time to flesh out its characters as well as deliver witty dialogue that is always a part of this movie's bigger budget American cousins . The plot builds well throughout as there's always enough going on to keep things interesting . It all boils down to a fabulous conclusion which serves in ensuring the movie gets the bloody end it deserves , as well as rounding off the story perfectly . The Big Racket features a great sleazy atmosphere , in which the story is able to flourish , and the catchy music score helps to make sure that the film is technically sound . Overall , The Big Racket is a must see film for both crime fans and cult fans and comes with high recommendations from me !
Entertaining and well done biopic	I'm not usually a fan of biopics , or even Martin Scorsese films in general , but surprisingly enough ; this one , in spite of it's lukewarm critical reaction , is actually really good , and definitely well worth seeing . Much of the criticism landed on The Aviator has come about because of the fact that it's not very deep and while this is a problem for the film , it didn't upset me too much because what we do have is a stylish and always interesting film , which evenly covers up it's shortfall in substance with it's positive aspects . The film follows the story of Howard Hughes ; an aeroplane and filmmaker in Hollywood's golden era . The film starts during the troubled shoot of Hughes ' debut film ; Hell's Angels , and ends somewhat prematurely as Hughes is still a young man . We are never really allowed to get into the subject's head , but this doesn't seem to be an accident , as it was obvious to me that Scorsese was more interested in portraying the history behind the man than his psychological profile . Scorsese gives us enough of the man to keep us interested in him , but stays true to the facts of his life to an extent in which the film is always kept interesting . Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have replaced Robert DeNiro as Scorsese's muse , and despite a disappointing turn in the sub-standard ' Gangs of New York ' , DiCaprio shines here and really does well as the rich , yet troubled , Hollywood icon at the centre of this story . Scorsese seems to have a bit overboard with the cast , as several big names of the present appear as big names of the past . Cate Blanchett irritated me just as much as the real Katherine Hepburn did , which shows the greatness of her performance . Kate Beckinsale and , surprisingly , Gwen Stefani give life to two of Hollywood's golden girls ; Ava Gardner and Jean Harlow as well , while smaller roles such as that of the charismatic Errol Flyn fall to the likes of Jude Law . This was the film's major selling point for me - there's something great about the big stars of today portraying the big stars of the golden age , and the way that Scorsese populates almost every scene with the big names of the time ensures that this is as much a film fan's movie as it is a multi-million dollar blockbuster . Critics can complain about a lack of substance as much as they like , but what I saw here was an excellently stylish take on one of Hollywood's most intriguing figures , and I don't hesitate to call this Scorsese's finest hour since Goodfellas back in 1990 .
Dark and atmospheric noir	This Gun for Hire was one of the earlier films in the film noir cycle , and was clearly shot on a budget ; but in spite of that , this is still an excellent little thriller and one that all fans of noir will surely enjoy ! The film works because of its compelling plot and intriguing characters ; and it's also surprisingly dark and atmospheric . The film features a breakout role for Alan Ladd , who would go on to star in a number of noir flicks throughout the forties ; and it also features a role for the beautiful Veronica Lake . The film focuses on cat loving hit-man Philip Raven . Raven does a job which involves killing the chemist and gets paid for it , but is not happy when he realises that he's been paid in hot bills . The police are soon on his tail ; but Raven is smart enough to give them the slip and decides to go after his former employers . Meanwhile , a policeman's girlfriend who works as a nightclub entertainer takes a job with the hit-man's employers ; and their paths inevitably cross . The film is very short at only seventy eight minutes , but director Frank Tuttle makes good use of this time and the film remains captivating for its duration . The plot flows very well indeed and things are kept very tight which helps to keep things entertaining . The central performance courtesy of Alan Ladd is excellent and the actor really does a good job in creating the right atmosphere for his character and it does the film a lot of favours . Starring opposite him is Veronica Lake who is given less to do but is never the less impressive . The atmosphere is very dark and the film draws suspense from this which ensures that it's always satisfying . The lead character is the main source of interest , and he's certainly very interesting ; but there's also plenty going on in terms of the plot . The film is not as complex as some other films in the noir cycle ; but it's fun and entertaining to watch and I'm sure any noir fan that catches this film will enjoy it . Recommended .
Superb cult horror !	After being pleasantly surprised by the first collaboration between Udo Kier , Joe Dallesandro , Paul Morrissey and Andy Warhol that I saw ; Blood For Dracula , I didn't think that this take on the classic Frankenstein story would be able to live up to it . There was another pleasant surprise in store , however , as after seeing it ; I am proud to say that it's even better than the aforementioned Blood For Dracula ! The way that the story pans out is relatively similar to what the team did with the Dracula story , in that the basics are retained but the gloves are off after that . This film can be aptly described as weird throughout , and this is a huge plus for the film as you never really know what to expect next . The film throws one odd idea after another at you , and it makes for a delightful ride . The plot follows doctor Frankenstein ( Udo Kier ) , who is conducting experiments in order to form his own race of people that will worship and obey him . To do this , he must create a male and female monster and have them mate but , of course , this plan causes some problems . . . Just as it was with Blood For Dracula , the central character here has been changed from morbidly curious and slightly too passionate scientist to out and out lunatic ! Udo Kier presents a fabulous portrayal of a deeply disturbed man and his over the top performance compliments the insanity in the rest of the movie brilliantly . The special effects in the film are massively over the top , but lots of fun and many sequences are just as hilarious as they are gory . The scene that sees someone get their head cut off with a pair of shears is a highlight , as is the blood-drenched finale ! There's quite a lot of soft-core porn in the movie as well , which adds to both the cult and the camp value of the film . Joe Dallesandro makes for a great hero lead . His persona and screen presence lend themselves well to the characters he is given in the two films and there's something about him that just screams ' cult ! ' at you . On the whole , Flesh for Frankenstein is a top quality horror flick . The gore blends well with the porn and the inventiveness and general weirdness of the movie make this essential viewing for fans of cult horror . Highly recommended !
A stunning and sadly underseen film noir !	This noir may not be the best remembered film from the era , but it features a great mystery plot , the common noir atmosphere and some good performances from its lesser known cast members . Robert Siodmak , the talented director behind the mystery / horror classic ' The Spiral Staircase ' directed this film two years earlier than the aforementioned film , and shows a real flair for creating a dark and brooding atmosphere as well as creating a plot that both intrigues and fascinates the viewer . Phantom Lady focuses on Scott Henderson ; a man married to a woman he doesn't like . He picks up a lady in a big hat in a bar one night , and the two agree to a ' no strings attached ' night of fun . However , he then returns home to find his apartment infested by police officers and soon finds out that the reason they are there is because his wife has been strangled with one of his neck ties ! He's dismayed to find that no one he saw while with the mysterious woman can remember her , and naturally the jury sends him down for the murder of his wife . However , luckily for him his beautiful female employee gets on the case . . . The plot moves along nicely throughout , and unlike many of the better known noirs , this one features a few murders which make the proceedings more interesting . In fact , if it wasn't for the fact that it was made in the forties and shot in black and white , I would swear Phantom Lady was an Italian Giallo ! The central characters are all interesting enough , with Alan Curtis providing a good portrayal of the unfortunate victim , and Ella Raines being effective as the female impromptu detective . The real standout of the film , however , is Franchot Tone , who provides a memorable performance as the insane villain of the piece . The film also features a role for supporting actor extraordinaire Elisha Cook Jr , who features playing the drums in the film's most memorable segment . If I was to criticise this film , I would say that the identity of the murderer is revealed a little too early - although Phantom Lady does deserve some credit on that front for the original way it goes about it . The conclusion is satisfying and everything makes sense ( which is amazing considering the unlikely plot line ) and overall , Phantom Lady is surely one of the greatest and most under-seen noirs ever made !
Excellent revenge fuelled western !	Death Rides a Horse clearly follows on the tail of Sergio Leone's masterpiece Dollars Trilogy as both the style and execution of it are very similar ; but there is more than enough here to ensure that the film both stands on it's own and stands out as one of the better of the many , many Spaghetti Westerns to come out of Italy . The atmosphere of the film is very dark indeed and it's clear that director Giulio Petroni wanted to ensure that his film was as brutal and unforgiving as possible - which he succeeds in doing and that helps the plot immensely . The plot is not particularly original and focuses on the common theme of revenge . The plot focuses on a man named Bill . Fifteen years after witnessing the murder of his family , Bill sets out to track down and kill those that did it . This coincides with the release from prison of Ryan ; a bandit who was double crossed by the same men who killed Bill's family . Despite going after the gang for different ends , the two men settle their differences and form an alliance to rain justice down on those that wronged them . The main character is Diabolik star John Phillip Law , but clearly the real standout of this film is Sergio Leone veteran Lee Van Cleef who is the biggest standout of the film in his role as Ryan ; the experienced gunslinger . His Western credentials were already cemented before the release of this film ; but it's no surprise that Death Rides a Horse is one of his best known efforts . The pair gets on well together and the way that the film builds a contrast between the youth and inexperience of Law's characters with the opposite elements of Van Cleef's is remarkable . The film benefits from yet another great Ennio Morricone score and the way that the plot flows is always interesting . Giulio Petroni obviously also favours Sergio Leone's use of the extreme close-up and the film features several of those . There's a fair bit of violence which is sure to please and while this film is not as great as the Dollars Trilogy from which it takes its influence ; it's certainly a top end Spaghetti Western that fans of this genre will not want to miss . Recommended !
If you want gore , you'll find it here !	Anthropophagus is one of the few films on the Video Nasty list that is still banned in Britain in its uncut form to this day ; and that really isn't surprising . While the film only features two heavy scenes of extreme violence , these two alone are good enough reason for the BBFC to get its scissors out and Joe D'Amato's Eurotrash masterpiece features a continually morbid and graphic tone throughout . The film kicks off with a sequence that could have come from any other slasher movie and sees a couple viciously savaged while trying to relax on a picturesque beach . This sequence sets exactly the right tone for the film ; as while it's derivative of a huge number of slasher movies ; it's clear that sleaze director Joe D'Amato is going to take this one further than we're used to going . The plot is splendidly simple , and sees a group of tourists arriving on a remote island after suffering boat problems . They soon realise that the local population has disappeared , and there's something sinister on their tail . . . and this is one psychopath that is never going to listen to reason ! The Greek island setting is superbly realised and the uninhabited settings make for a great location for a film like this to take place . You would expect this movie to suffer from poor production values , but actually that isn't the case . Despite the largely very poor acting ( from esteemed cult figures such as George Eastman and Tisa Farrow ) , the film is well shot and D'Amato utilises a series of macabre elements , which ensures that the film works as a horror movie as well as a grisly shocker . The killer at the centre of the movie really is a great creation and something far different from the norm . While the murderer is a definitely beast , D'Amato gives him a human quality and some attempt is made to show how he became what he is - which overall makes the whole thing much more shocking . This film is notorious for a scene that involves The Beast and a pregnant woman , and it lives up to its reputation of being sick beyond belief . However , you've got to respect D'Amato for this ; as merely having the balls to show it is something that most director's lack . The ending of the movie is superb , and provides a great climax for the title character . Overall , I highly recommend this movie to fans of Euro horror . . . just so long as you've got the guts !
A well done homage to seventies Grindhouse cinema	Well , I have to say that I wasn't at all impressed when I found out that the Weinstein's had decided to chop ' Grindhouse ' in half for the UK release , and at one point I wasn't even going to make a trip to the cinema to see each individual part . . . but then Death Proof got it's release and I ended up having to be there . It's always been clear that Tarantino is a fan of seventies Grindhouse , and he does an excellent job here of setting the scene and putting the movie squarely in the seventies . . . well , he would have done if it wasn't for the mobile phones shots and characters who mention the internet and CGI ( what the HELL ? ? ) . Anyway , the plot is typical seventies B-movie trash , and focuses on a stuntman named Mike ( or ' Stuntman Mike ' ) who gets his kicks by meeting and chatting up hot young women , before brutally smashing them to pieces in his specialised ' death proof ' stunt car . We are introduced to a trio of hot young ladies early on in the film , and it's not long before Stuntman Mike sets his sights on the group and has his fun with them . . . One of the major problems with the extended cut that I saw is the fact that it's too long ! Quentin Tarantino obviously values dialogue , but there's just too much of it and it's not as interesting as the chit chat in the likes of Reservoir Dogs . However , I did find out after seeing the film that the ' missing reel ' in the American release was actually the lap dance scene in this version - and since it's the best part of the movie , I think I can stand a bit of boring dialogue ! Tarantino lovingly implements many of the problems with cheap seventies exploitation flicks - stuff like bad editing and glitches , as well as a scene that suddenly switches into black and white . . . it's well done . Death Proof is a film of two halves , the first half being the far better of the two , though it never completely grinds to a halt and the second half of the film features an excellent car chase . The cast is one of the most interesting things about the film - I was extremely excited to see Kurt Russell back on the big screen after far too long , and he makes the best of his role as the deranged psycho at the centre of the film . There's no shortage of eye candy either - with ladies including Vanessa Ferlito , Rose McGowan and Sydney Poitier ( that's Sydney with a ' y ' ! ) providing the film with enough highlights ! ( Oddly , no nudity though ) . Overall , this is not a film without problems - but it's highly entertaining stuff , and fans of seventies Grindhouse flicks will no doubt enjoy it ! Recommended .
First rate Fulci	When people think of Lucio Fulci , it's always his gorier and largely incoherent efforts that spring to mind . Films like Zombie Flesh-Eaters and The Beyond , which are most definitely good films if you like that sort of thing ( as I certainly do ! ) ; but they don't adequately portray the man's talent . If you want to see the ' great ' Fulci films , you need to go back to his Giallo days with films like Don't Torture a Duckling and indeed this film ; A Lizard in Woman's Skin . Fulci's first Giallo is a trippy thriller that excellently captures the laid back style of the swinging sixties and blends it magnificently with the thrilling pace that has gone on to epitomise the Italian thriller . The film follows a young woman ( Florinda Bolkan ) who dreams that she is having orgies with a hippy woman that lives downstairs . Events take a turn for the worse when the young woman dreams that she's killed the hippy , who then turns up dead ; brutally murdered in her apartment , in exactly the way that the woman dreamt . . . While this film isn't as brutal as some of the later Giallo efforts , Fulci succeeds in creating a foreboding atmosphere and manages to keep his audience on the edge of their seats . The plot line is rather strange , and Fulci makes best use of this through an excellent Ennio Morricone score , which firmly instills the trippy atmosphere in the viewers mind . The Giallo has come to be synonymous with brutal murders and lots of gore but , ironically , Fulci keeps his murders down a minimum and some of them even happen off screen . This is both a good and a bad thing as I , personally , like seeing brutal murders in Giallo's ; but on the other hand it allows Fulci to keep the focus firmly on the central murder and he doesn't get sidetracked with lots of blood and gore , which does the film itself lots of favours . The mystery boils down to an excellent ending , in which the film is tied up nicely and we are treated to a great twist and some first rate detective work from the detective on the case . Highly recommended viewing and a must for Giallo fans !
The American Dream / Nightmare	Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider is often cited as being an all time classic , and while I don't think this is a great film in terms of technical brilliance , it sums up the era it was made and the tongue in cheek , cynical take on the ' American dream ' is both potent and well done . This film is very much a product of the sixties and , like many things from the decade , will always be fondly remembered . Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda , men of substance and substance abuse , wrote the film together and Hopper directed it . These two were obviously in the thick of what was cool in the sixties , and that gives the film an element of authenticity as we feel like what we're seeing isn't too far away from the things really going on at that time . The plot is simple and more just a base for the film to deliver it's real sting than anything else . It follows two motorbike riders on their way from Los Angeles to the Mardi Gras in New Orleans . We follow their exploits as they travel the country meeting various people including , most notably , George Hanson ; an offbeat lawyer , played by the great Jack Nicholson . The American Dream has always been about freedom . But like George Hanson says ; it's one thing to talk about being free , but something else entirely to actually be it . That's the theme of the entire movie , and the way that it plays out , and the ending especially , aptly portray the difference between saying something and actually doing it . The acting performances are a big part of the movie , and the two leads ; Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper stick out the most . The two actors brilliantly get into their characters , and after a while you forget that you're watching actors and start to think that these people really are these characters . Jack Nicholson turns up halfway through and steals the show . It's not hard to see why this actor went on to become one of the best of all time . Even here , he shows his charisma and ability to steal the show and that is what he would go on to become famous for doing later in his career . Last but not least , another great thing about Easy Rider is the music . Music was , of course , a big thing in the sixties ; and it's a big thing about this movie . Classic rock accompanies the pictures of the two men rider their bikes , and it's very cool indeed . On the whole , this film is an out and out classic .
Deranged indeed !	Deranged is an adaptation of the same story that inspired such horror classics as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Psycho and Silence of the Lambs , among others . It's the story of deranged psychotic Edward Gein , only in this film the story is a lot closer to how it actually happened than in any of the classics that it influenced . Deranged is a film not for the feint hearted . Shot on an extremely low budget of just two hundred thousand dollars , the directorial team of Jeff Gillen and Alan Ormsby have created one of the most vile and disgusting films that I've ever seen . Subtitled ' Confessions of a Necrophile ' for the US market , Deranged tells the story of Ezra Cobb ; a simple farm owner who lives with his domineering mother . After her death , Ezra gradually slips into insanity ; starting with the unearthing of his yearlong dead mother from the grave . Ezra then decides that she needs patching up , and so embarks on unearthing more bodies for the task . It isn't long , however , before the psychopath is on the rampage for fresher victims . . . Deranged goes all out to shock from the outset . The image of Ezra carrying his dead mother into her bedroom is sickening in a way that few movies manage . The amoral attitude of the character adds to this sickness , and ensures that most audience members will be uncomfortable watching this film . Deranged benefits from a superb lead performance courtesy of Roberts Blossom . Blossom does an amazing job of convincing us that he really is the psycho at the centre of the film . Usually in films like this , I am firmly on the side of the killer ; not really caring about the victims - but Blossom is so vile in this film that I was actually praying he DIDN'T catch his prey ! The film has a short running time , but this time is used excellently on a series of nasty and weird sequences , and the movie never really lets the pace go once it has set itself up . On the whole , this film has gained itself a cult following for a reason . It's certainly not for everyone's taste , and it's not as good as the most famous of the films that the story has influenced - but if you like your cinema to grisly and shocking ; Deranged is a film that you should seek out !
A cultural masterpiece	The Italian Job is one of the best-loved British classics ever made . Most people in my home country of Britain have seen the film many times ( most of those times spent drinking tea and speaking like the queen , of course ) , but there's more than enough for audiences from other countries to like about this delightful thriller as well . As you almost certainly already know , The Italian Job stars Michael Caine as the criminal at the centre of the job , dubbed ' The Italian Job ' ( would you believe ) . Caine is iconic in this film ; his voice and mannerisms are often imitated , and it is this film that is probably most responsible for that . The plot follows Charlie Croker ( Caine ) , a freshly released crook that , with a tip off from a deceased friend , decides to steal £4 million from Italy . However , it's not an easy job and there are many risks involved , so the job must be astutely planned and flawlessly executed for it to work right - and it is there that the film really takes off . The Italian Job is well remembered for two things , the first of which is the Mini's . This is the film that made Mini's cool , so as you might expect , there is a fair amount of stunt work involving the Mini , a lot of which is truly spectacular - these little cars can be seen driving up stairs , onto and across roofs , through shopping centres , flying over various chasms etc and it's all very exciting . The second thing that it is remembered for is , of course , the line - " you were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off ! " , which is one of the most quoted of all time . The film's impact on popular culture has been immense , and that line's impact in particular is legendary ; people that don't know the film know that line , and I dare say that a lot of them quote it even . It's up there with ' I'll be back ' or ' that ' line from Dirty Harry . The film also highlights a lot of British culture , most notably the reaction to something going right . English patriotism is a little different to the American version - while in America , the whole country may be united under the stars and stripes , very apple pie-like ; England is much more content to chant a little inside of a prison . I know which version I prefer . I could waffle on all day about this film , but we've both got better things to do , I'm sure so I'll finish by commenting on the ending ; which is , simply , sublime and a perfect way to end the film ; funny , well executed and absolutely genius . Well played .
An excellent Holmes mystery !	I'm a big fan of the original Universal Sherlock Holmes series and while there have been attempts by other studios to make films based on the classic character by Arthur Conan Doyle , only Hammer Horror's take on The Hound of the Baskervilles has come close to touching the majesty of Universal's films . However , for my money , A Study in Terror is both an excellent take on Sherlock Holmes and certainly one of the best films about the great London detective outside of Universal's efforts . This film is not based on an actual story by Arthur Conan Doyle and instead we get a story in same style as Doyle's that pits Sherlock against another notable historical figure , Jack the Ripper . Sherlock Holmes becomes interested in a series of murders happening around Whitechapel with prostitutes as the victims after a parcel containing a set of surgical instruments is anonymously delivered to his address . After inspecting the case , he soon comes up with some clues and begins following the trail which leads him to the seedy underbelly of Victorian London . . . It seems this film was directly trying to imitate the classic Universal ones as the two lead actors are very similar to Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce . Neither is as good , of course , but John Neville gives an excellent performance as the eloquent detective , while Donald Houston is right on cue as Holmes ' understudy . The film also features the good natured humour of the earlier series and that makes the film more enjoyable to watch . Director James Hill does an excellent job of creating an atmosphere for the film ; the foggy streets of London are great and suitably fit the macabre storyline . The story itself is an interesting one and it plays out well also . The mystery is constantly engaging and the few murders featured are enough to spice it up . The story features enough red herrings and clues to keep the audience and Holmes guessing and the mystery elements are certainly satisfying enough . The identity of the ripper is not abundantly obvious by the end and the film's conclusion is good . Overall , I enjoyed this film very much and can certainly recommend it to my fellow Holmes fans !
Weird and compelling - an excellent swan song for Naschy's career !	Paul Naschy is certainly a big contender for Spain's biggest ever horror star ; with a great deal of cult films under his belt , most notably his " Homo Lobo " series . However , since the seventies his fame has dwindled somewhat ; but on the evidence of this film , his acting and writing talent certainly hasn't ! Rojo Sangre is a strange and wayward film that won't appeal to all tastes ; but it's certainly an interesting cult film and the fact that it's a semi-autobiographical film for Paul Naschy makes it all the more interesting . The plot focuses on Pablo Thevenet ; a down and out actor with nothing but bad luck . His daughter was murdered and his wife left him , and despite once being a big star ; he now can't find any sort of acting work . He gets something of a break when he's offered a job as a ' living statue ' at a Stag club , and although he finds the role demeaning ; he takes it because the money is good and no other offers are coming his way . His hatred for the modern movie business is overwhelming , however , and it's not long before he begins a murderous tirade against all those that have stopped him from getting work . The thing I liked most about this film is the way that the plot moves . It's never obvious where the film is going and Naschy's script always allows some surprises . The direction is taken up by Christian Molina , and I'm sure the last name will be familiar to Naschy fans as it's his son ! Molina's direction is always assured and he manages several stylish moments . The film is perhaps a little too flashy , but everything in the direction bodes well with the way that the story is presented . The film is bolstered courtesy of an excellent performance by Paul Naschy ; perhaps even the best of his career . The fact that the role reflects upon his own career aside , you can't fail but be impressed with Naschy here ; he absolutely becomes the central character and you can never doubt him for a second . One of the many subplots of the film features the central character slashing up various people while dressed as historical characters and this provides the film with some of its best moments . The gore is actually quite restrained but it's still nice to see . There's not really a defining point to the film and the ending contains more questions than answers but it does at least bring some closure to the plot . Overall , Rojo Sangre is an excellent swan song for Naschy's career and I'm sure that fans of the great Spanish actor's career will appreciate it .
Spider-Man swings back in style !	Well , I've been looking forward to this movie ever since I walked out of Spider-Man 2 , and despite all the bad things I've heard about it - Spider-Man 3 certainly didn't disappoint ! Sure , you could spend all day picking faults with the film if you really wanted to , but what's the point ? The first two films set the bar very high for comic book movies , and this film is not a disappointment considering what went before it . I have to say that I'm not a ' Spiderman fanboy ' and have , in fact , not even read the comics ; but that is testament to the brilliance of Sam Raimi's vision as he has managed to turn Spider-Man into a franchise that is accessible to everyone . The plot this time around is far more complex than in the last two . Spider-Man's celebrity status has grown among the people of New York City . His private life is going well also . However , good things never last long ; and Spider-Man is about to face a threat from his former best friend Harry Osborne who wants revenge for the death of his father , as well as a ' simian ' life form from another planet and the return of his uncle's killer , this time in the guise of powerful new villain ' Sandman ' . The most outstanding thing about this film is definitely the special effects . The fight scenes are brilliantly realised , and Sam Raimi certainly knows how to put a thrilling compilation together . The Sandman provides Spider-Man 3 with its best visuals , as the Terminator 2-style villain switches between sand and flesh in style , and the director constantly makes good use of this set-up . The visuals are obviously important in a film like this , and the film contains many a memorable scene . The best of these sequences come in the form of the creation of the villains , and while it has to be said that the way they come about is a little convenient ( Sandman stumbles upon a nuclear experiment with sand . . . ) , it's not too difficult to believe since the film takes place in a world where a human / spider hybrid fights criminals in New York City . Popular Spider-Man villain Venom makes an appearance also , albeit it a brief one . However , the way that his character is built up makes up for the lack of screen time that the resulting villain has . One of the most common problems viewers have picked out with this film is the fact that there are a lot of different plot lines going on . It's true that the film does become more than a little bit complex and the new characters suffer as a result of that . But the Spider-Man Universe is obviously a vast one , and Sam Raimi had a lot on his plate when it came to writing a story that would please the fans , stay true to the comics and entertain the audience . He actually juggles the numerous plot threads very well , as most of the points get across and the impending plot holes aren't enough to spoil anyone's enjoyment . Sam Raimi's sense of humour is brilliant , it was obvious that the likes of J . K . Simmons and B-movie legend Bruce Campbell were going to provide comic relief ( and they do ) , but the funniest thing about the film for me was Peter Parker's reaction to the black suit . In a sequence that seems to be rather widely disliked , Spidey goes from geeky physics student to a ( sort of ) suave lady-killer with hilarious results . The sequence shows a lot more imagination than many directors would have given the idea of a superhero turned ' dark ' . The acting is largely decent also . The returning characters all give performances that you would expect from there , while the new additions fit in well . Thomas Hayden Church pretty much sleepwalks through his role , but he's still an asset to the film as he completely looks and feels like he has come straight out of a comic book ! Topher Grace is slimy and irritating as he should be , and the sequence immediately before he changes into Venom says a lot about his character . Overall , Spider-Man 3 is not exactly a perfect film - but it's certainly an entertaining one and I know for sure that I'll be seeing it again !
Fear of the unknown ; the most frightening of all	Every time I see The Twilight Zone , I become more and more impressed with it ! Nothing in the Dark is a story about the most frightening thing known to man ; the unknown . The themes of mortality and fear are well felt in a story of an old woman who forces herself to remain in her small tin shack . She remains there through fear ; fear that death may claim her . When she finds a young wounded policeman on her doorstep , she faces a dilemma - does she let him in , and risk letting death claim her - or does she let him die ? This episode is shot entirely inside one room , and yet never becomes dull or uninteresting . The claustrophobic feel bodes well with the dark plot , and the way that the program takes an age-old fear and spins a story out of it is fantastic . Gladys Cooper is excellent in the lead role ; delivering a performance that is both abstract , yet believable at the same time . The episode also features an early role for one Robert Redford , who gives an early glimpse of his charisma in his role as the policeman . The climax to the tale will probably be guessed way before the ending ; but The Twilight Zone is never completely predictable , and it still manages to pull something out of the bag at the end ! Nothing in the Dark is surely one of the best episodes of Rod Serling's " The Twilight Zone " and comes hugely recommended from me !
Majestic movie making in every respect	In 1981 , Sam Raimi unleashed himself ( and Bruce Campbell ) onto the film world with his first masterpiece ; The Evil Dead . Since then , Raimi has gone on to make many films , and hasn't disappointed with a single one . And that more than includes this one . It has become a common opinion among certain people that movies which are heavy on action are brainless and therefore can't be intelligent or have an emotional impact on the audience . The first Spider-Man , and the X-Men films have already disproved this theory ; but Spiderman 2 puts it beyond a shadow of a doubt . Many movies that try to blend together several elements end up falling down somewhere , but Spiderman 2 manages to blend more than a few , and blend them into one coherent masterpiece . Within the plot are elements of romance , sci-fi , action , comedy , drama , fantasy , and even a little bit of horror , Many films that have tried to blend several elements have failed , but here they all blend together nicely . All the elements of the plot come together , and all are definitely needed for the movie to flow ; it is obvious that all these things weren't put in the movie just so the film could profess that it has lots of different elements ; there is nothing in the plot of this movie that could be taken out without making the rest of the movie fall apart ; in that way , the movie is efficient and yet expansive and ambitious at the same time . The movie starts as it means to go on ; with a very exciting pizza delivery sequence . Yes , even pizza delivery is exciting in Spiderman 2 . After that the movie is a roller coaster ride ; when it's not dazzling you with adrenaline fuelled action sequences , it's pulling at your heart strings with emotionally rich exchanges . Some action films let up when they aren't giving the audience an action sequence ; but this one doesn't . It's exciting all the way though . Some of the exchanges , particularly the ones between Aunt May and Peter Parker are genuinely heart felt , and because the characters are so well thought-out and appear on screen as rounded human beings ; these exchanges are allowed licence to make you care for the characters . The characters in the movie are a mixed bag , with each one being made up of a number of desires and insecurities , which translate onto the screen both effectively and believably , even in spite of some of them having super powers . Technically , this movie is majestic . The action sequences are truly breathtaking and seeing Spider-Man battle Doctor Octopus around a number of different locations is an unforgettable experience . The acting is also something of note , as the movie is brought to life by a brilliant ensemble . I don't like Tobey Maguire much , but he was made for the role of Peter Parker , and he really does excel with it . The role wouldn't have been believable if it was filled by someone butch , and so Maguire makes for a believable Spider-Man . Kirsten Dunst doesn't have as much to do here as she did last time , but what she does do is just fine . The great Alfred Molina fills the role of Doctor Octopus , and like Tobey Maguire was made for the part . Simply put , he's immense in this role ; he's intelligent looking enough to be believable as the scientist and nasty looking enough to be believable as the super-villain ; thus capturing the essence of his character in both respects . J . K . Simmons steals the show as J . J . Jameson , the head of the newspaper in downtown Manhattan . Every scene with him is a delight and much of his dialogue is absolutely hilarious , which gives the film that all-important third dimension . As previously mentioned , Sam Raimi started life as the director of the fantastic cult hit ; The Evil Dead . Despite this film being completely different and on a much bigger scale than the aforementioned ; it is evident that Sam hasn't lost his roots . Obviously giving Bruce Campbell a cameo shows this ( although I'd have preferred more Bruce , myself ) , and Sam also reminds us of The Evil Dead with several tributes including a lovely chainsaw sequence , and a workout for the ' Raimi-cam ' on the train scenario . The Evil Dead was notable for , amongst other things , the fact that it was extremely well directed . Sam Raimi is an extremely underrated talent and really should be mentioned along with the directors that hog all the praise more often . His direction is extremely assured , and he manages to make everything about the film thrilling and as interesting as it possibly could be . Spider-Man 2 is a film that further disproves the theory that movies based on comic books are brainless and stands out as one of the very best films this decade , not to mention it being a member of the exclusive ' sequels better than the first ' club . If you haven't already ; see this movie pronto .
Cult camp class !	To be honest , I absolutely love trash like this ! Maniac Cop is a film that clearly isn't too caught up with trying to establish itself alongside the more professional efforts of the horror genre , and instead simply revels in it's B-movie status . This gives the film free reign to do whatever it wants to do , as it doesn't have to worry about coherency or logic and this helps it massively as the final result shows . Actually , surprisingly enough ; this is a rather professionally handled B-movie and many of the reasons why it works are down to things like atmosphere and characters , which are the things that the film isn't supposed to be bothered about . The plot is well worked also , and the way that the mystery pans out is exciting in all the right places . The story follows a problem in New York . Innocent citizens are turning to the police for help as usual ; but one officer isn't bowing to the law , and has taken it upon himself to dish out justice his own way . This maniac cop is exterminating the local population , and it's up to framed copper Jack Forrest and his mistress Theresa Mallory to save the day ! The way that director William Lustig portrays the New York streets gives this film a lot of it's power . It's gritty , in the same way that many of the seventies cop thrillers were and this , when combined with the thick eighties trash crust , is what makes this film a winner . The scenes that see the maniac cop taking people out are fiendishly funny , but also quite shocking . The police are looked up to in most societies , and it would be a huge problem if one of them were to start dishing out the wrong kind of law themselves . Scriptwriter and B-movie god Larry Cohen seems keen to portray this too , with much of the action taking in the panic that previous events have caused . One of this film's main assets is definitely the presence of Evil Dead's Ash , Bruce Campbell . Campbell isn't quite as over the top as he was in Sam Raimi's classic trilogy - but he's playing a different character and just seeing him is a good reason to see this film . He is joined by fellow B-movie actor Tom Atkins , as well as Laurene Landon and Robert Z'Dar , who is perfectly cast in the title role . This isn't a film that will please fans of serious movies - but if you like your silly B-grade films , you'll definitely like this !
Brilliantly realised commentary on the darker side of human nature - Chabrol's masterpiece !	Of all the great films that Claude Chabrol made ; The Breach is one of the most often praised , and that is not surprising at all as this film sees the great French director at the absolute top of his game and deserves every good word said about it ! As ever with Chabrol , what we have here is a film that thrills on the surface but has much more going on beneath it . The characters are undoubtedly the most important thing about the film ; and the director ensures that each one is brought to life effectively and believably , and this ensures that the film's many substantial points can come through . The film begins with a surreal sequence that could be something out of a zombie movie , as we see a dishevelled man emerge from the bathroom in just a robe and proceed to attack his wife Hélène . His attention soon moves on to the small boy and after putting the kid in hospital , the wife decides to file for a divorce . However , things are not so simple as her husband's father happens to be one of the richest and most powerful men in town , so he won't let Hélène take his grandson from him without a fight . . . and hires the immoral Paul Thomas to dig up some dirt on Hélène . The film doesn't contain a great deal of excitement in the common thriller sense , but Chabrol keeps his audience on the edge of their seats by way of the characters and the atmosphere . The film centres on a boarding house and the people that live there ; and the interaction between them makes up the bulk of the film . The main theme on display is an attack against the rich ; this comes through plainly and obviously through the character of Ludovic Régnier ; a man who has enough money to always get what he wants and not care about who gets trampled in the process . The outlook of the film is very bleak all round and Chabrol seems keen to show the dark side of human nature as much as possible . The central plot line , which involves a man trying to prove that an upstanding woman is an unfit mother by any means necessary , is very bleak in the way it plays out . As ever with Chabrol , the acting is excellent and he has put together a great cast here that includes his then wife and frequent muse , the beautiful Stéphane Audran in the lead role and a support cast that features superb performances from the likes of Jean-Pierre Cassel and Michel Bouquet . The film has a very unique style that fluctuates throughout ; as mentioned , the first five minutes or so almost seem like something out a zombie movie and then it moves into more familiar Chabrol territory before changing again for the climax as the director gives us a very strange and striking hallucination sequence . Overall , this is an excellent thriller that comes highly recommended and I may even rate it as Chabrol's best .
Excellent little Hammer yarn !	The Reptile is famous for the fact that it utilises the same sets as the brilliant ' Plague of the Zombies ' , and as such ; you would expect the rest of the film not to be up to Hammer's usual standards . This couldn't be further from the truth ! While this may not be Hammer's best work , all the things that us fans have come to expect from this great studio are present , along with a few other little surprises . The film follows a man and his wife who move to a small village to live in the cottage that the man's brother left him . The brother died in mysterious circumstances . . . and our hero makes it his business to find out why . This plot is good enough , but it's the other one that really sparks the interest . The film introduces a brand new monster - the Snake Woman ! Dracula , Frankenstein's Monster etc are all fine ; but we've seen them all before . I have a lot of respect for this film just due to the fact that it's got something different on offer . The Snake Woman is an unfortunate victim of a curse . . . and she stalks the local population on the moors at night . The film features a lot of suspense , and it pretty much runs throughout the entire run time . We are always on tender hooks to uncover the mystery behind the mystifying Snake Woman , and this is helped by the way that the plot continues to deal out cards , without telling the audience exactly what is going on until the end . The only real problem with the film is that the mythology never really explained in any great detail . . . the film , having a new monster at it's centre , would have benefited greatly from delving a little more into how she came about . This film is notable for Hammer fans because of the fact that the studio's favourite co-star , Michael Ripper , has got himself a starring role ! This actor has done so much for Hammer films , and it's good to see him in a larger role for a change . The film benefits from the traditional Hammer style , including both lavish sets and a sense of goodwill that runs throughout . The film's climax is really good , as it provides an answer to both the plots running during the film , and even manages a little poetic justice ! On the whole - don't miss this one . It may not be Hammer's best - or most famous - but I'm already looking forward to seeing it again !
Macabre story of coffins and corpses . . . this is great stuff !	The Flesh and the Fiends is similar , in a lot of ways , to the Val Lewton produced Robert Wise film , The Body Snatcher , but for some reason ; this one has flown further under the radar . It's odd , because despite the greatness of the other film ; The Flesh and the Fiends is a lot better , and has the added malevolence of being based on a true-life story . The film takes place in Edinburgh , and director John Gilling does an excellent job of ensuring that the city looks as foreboding as possible , and the perfect home for a story as macabre as this one . The film follows the idea of having to break eggs to make an omelette , and sees Doctor Robert Knox buying corpses from a couple of murderous grave robbers in order for him to have subjects , from which new surgical procedures can be ascertained . The real stars of the show , however , are the graverobbers themselves ; Burke and Hare . They begin their careers by simply taking bodies from graves ; but once they realise how lucrative the business of selling cadavers is , they soon resort to making a few corpses of their own . . . The biggest name in the cast is the one belonging to the great Peter Cushing . Cushing has shown throughout his career that he is capable of a number of different roles , and his role here is one of the best he's had . He gets to sink his teeth into the character of Doctor Knox . In fact , this man isn't a world away from Cushing's world-beating turn as Doctor Frankenstein in Hammer's classic series , which explains why Cushing is so good at it . George Rose and Donald Pleasance give the film its extra dimension in the roles of the graverobbers . Rose is good , but it's Pleasance who really stands out in this film . Seeing him in a role like this is actually quite heartbreaking ; as here we see how great he can be , rendering his roles in films like Halloween even more of a waste of time . The plot plays out from a number of different angles , ensuring that there's always enough going on around the central plot to ensure that the film never dries up and becomes boring . It's strange that a film of this quality could fly straight under the radar ; but somehow it has . However , copies of this are out there ; and it definitely is well worth tracking down !
Another excellent exhibition of horror from Italy !	You can always count on an inventive and intriguing movie when it comes to anything that Argento has touched , and this Argento-scripted film is just that ! The great director has left the directorial duties up to his protégé ; Michele Soavi for this movie , and that is somewhat ironic because The Sect easily tops anything that Argento himself directed in the 1990's . Michele Soavi looked pretty promising up until 1994 when he released the astonishing ' Dellamorte Dellamore ' , and then promptly disappeared off the horror radar . It's a massive shame that the man , up until now , hasn't followed up on his four horror films ; as I , and many other horror fans ( I'm sure ) , would agree that if he'd added a few more films to his oeuvre ; he could be right up there with the master himself . The plot for this film follows a young woman who almost knocks a man down while driving in her car . She then takes the man home , but due to the events that transpire ; it quickly becomes obvious that she didn't take him home purely by chance . . . As soon as the movie opens , with America's " Horse With No Name " , and then a character quoting lyrics from The Rolling Stones ' " Sympathy for the Devil " , you just know that you're going to be in for a great ride ; and the rest of the film doesn't disappoint ! Soavi succeeds in creating a fabulously foreboding atmosphere throughout the movie , and his direction isn't bad either . The locations are great ; the underwater labyrinth underneath the house at the centre of the movie , which echoes Inferno , being the very best in that department ! Soavi excels at direction , and this only reinforces my point about the massive shame it is that he hasn't followed up on Dellamorte Dellamore . His camera angles are superb and he really knows how to build tension and suspense ! Herbert Lom is the pick of the cast , and the classic horror actor delivers an excellent hammy performance and every moment he's on screen is a delight . The film definitely does have problems , however ; the fact that it's about twenty minutes overlong is one of them , and the rather silly ending is another - but on the whole , this is an excellent exhibition of horror and comes with a high recommendation from yours truly !
Not brilliant , but still a decent Giallo	The Italian mystery , or ' Giallo ' sub genre is great . You can almost always count on an entertaining ride while watching a Giallo and while ' My Dear Killer ' isn't one of the top examples of the sub genre , it definitely does deliver a good time and fans of the style of films will not be disappointed by it . Some Giallo's follow a more urban setting ( Seven Blood Stained Orchids , The Case of the Bloody Iris ) while others take place in the rural countryside ( Don't Torture a Duckling , House With the Laughing Windows ) . The latter often make for the better films , and My Dear Killer is a part of the rural Giallo section . I actually prefer the cityscape for a mystery setting , but it doesn't matter because it's always the plot that's more important than the setting anyway . The plot is here is pretty much Giallo-standard , and it follows a detective on the case of a murder that seems to be linked to a horrific crime that took place years earlier . As usual , he follows leads and gets deeper and deeper into the mystery ; when he finds that there's more to the case than originally met the eye . . . The film starts off with a very unusual murder scene . It sees someone killed via a big mechanical digger , and while this scene is rather silly and over the top ; it does show that the film obviously isn't afraid to go over the top . I was surprised to find after the opener that the film only features on other stylish murder and although it's very nice ; girl sliced up with a circular saw , I tend to expect a bit more gore when watching this sort of film . The locations in the movie are rather uninspired , but this doesn't stop director Tonino Valerii presenting a nice atmosphere that helps to make the film more exciting and interesting . The lead role is taken by Giallo regular and star of The Case of the Bloody iris , George Hilton . It's quite clear that he's done this sort of thing before , as his performance gives the impression that he's not all that interested in his subject material . Still , it doesn't matter because the plot is interesting enough and this , combined with an intriguing mystery and some nice nudity and gore make this an admirable entry in the list of ' Giallos ' .
Great Euroshock classic - Pete Walker has outdone himself !	I didn't go into this film with very high expectations because I didn't like Pete Walker's Frightmare very much ; but House of Whipcord is a vastly superior film and , to be honest , I'm shocked that this doesn't get mentioned more often ! Pete Walker's film is both a sleazy seventies exploitation classic and a striking indictment of the justice system . The film serves as a warning against what would happen if private institutions were given the power to decide what is apt punishment for certain crimes , and the dedication of the film to all those who believe in capital punishment shows Pete Walker's love for controversy . The plot takes place in an old house , which doubles up as a private institution ran by a senile judge , his unforgiving partner ; the female warden of the prison and two equally vile female orderlies . They punish girls for crimes committed that weren't , in their eyes , properly punished by the corrupt British courts . We pick the story up when a young French girl is inducted into the institution . The atmosphere of the film is brilliant ; Pete Walker always ensures that the action is sleazy , and yet oddly erotic at the same time . The film is very matriarchal , and it's the female characters that are the protagonists while the men exist in background roles . However , the film isn't feminist ; and , in fact , is the exact opposite ; as the director ensures that none of the women are portrayed in a favourable light . The film benefits from a handful of great performances ; the best of which coming from Barbara Markham , who gives a powerhouse performance in the role of the head of the institution . Frightmare star Sheila Keith , and Dorothy Gordon are the orderlies , while Patrick Barr is brilliantly understated in his role as the ineffective Justice of the prison . Penny Irving is the young French victim at the centre of the story ; but her performance is brought down by her ridiculous French accent ! The story is another major strong point for this film , as Pete Walker ensures that it always moves well and although you wouldn't expect it from a Euroshock movie like this - he also makes it easy to care about the characters and what happens to them . On the whole , this is a vastly underrated and under seen seventies gem that must be seen by anyone who gets the chance to see it !
Superb and immensely enjoyable Ealing comedy	Ealing studios are well known for creating brilliantly witty comedies , and this is surely one of the best of them ! The Ladykillers follows Alec Guinness and his band of crooks as they infiltrate an old woman's home and attempt to rob a bank in the process . Guinness ' plan is so brilliant that the old dear herself is included in the plot - but nothing is ever that simple , especially not when your cohorts aren't the sharpest tools in the shed . The film works from a backbone consisting of very dry black humour and some slapstick thrown in for good measure , and the result is a film that is as easy to like as it is hilariously enjoyable . Despite a recent remake , they don't make films like this anymore and seeing the dark , but still good willed humour in this film is very refreshing indeed . What the film portrays is , in a way , quite horrifying , but the way that it's done is so well timed comically that it's hard to be frightened or disgusted by the idea of a lodgers not being quite what they seem , and far easier - and more enjoyable - to simply go along with the ensemble of brilliant characters that Ealing studios had put together ! It's quite a cast that this movie has . Just being lead by Alec Guinness is impressive enough , but when you throw in the likes of Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom to help him out , the cast becomes one of the film's main assets . Guinness puts in a superb performance , which excellently sums up the movie in the way that it straddles the line between creepiness and comedy . Herbert Lom is my pick of the supporting players . He steals every scene he's in , and his " no-nonsense " persona bodes brilliantly with the film and the characters that he's surrounded by . The characters can easily be called cliché - we've got the big dumb crook , the dippy old lady etc ; but it's the way that the actors delve into the clichés that makes the performances memorable and the film a winner . Most of the laughs come about as a result of the characters and the way that they act - while the film's running joke , and the trademark Ealing ironic climax - come about through the plot . The Ladykillers is an all time classic and a film that will be enjoyed for many decades to come for that reason - it's judged it's plot and it's characters perfectly , and it's very hard on the whole to find anything wrong with this film at all .
