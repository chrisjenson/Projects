God awful	I can never wrap my head around the careers of Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant . On television , their work is some of the best comedy of the past couple of decades : The State , Viva Variety ! , and , their triumph , Comedy Central's Reno 911 . But when they write movies , the results are well nigh unwatchable . I had thought in the past that they were just defecating cheap movie scripts so that they could make money and continue producing fine work on television . I mean , The Pacifier , Herbie : Fully Loaded and Night at the Museum smack of the kind of audience-despising material you might expect from smart writers deliberately trying to dumb down their work for some cold hard cash . Add to that the fact that their movie version of Reno 911 , which was released early in 2007 , was pretty good . But then , later in the year , they made this film . It's a cheesy little comedy , and it has a lot of potential to be decent , if unremarkable , fun . This is their genre , unlike the children's flicks . There's no conceivable reason to hate your audience here , since presumably they'll be pretty close to the same audience that watches Reno 911 . Dan Fogler plays a former child prodigy and Olympic table tennis player . Now he's a loser , but he's being recruited by the FBI to infiltrate an underground ping-pong tournament , hosted by an international criminal , played by Christopher Walken . The premise , reminiscent of other recent underground sports comedies like Dodgeball and Beerfest , doesn't have a lot of promise , it's true . But all a comedy really needs is some good jokes , and it'll fly . Or at least you'd think it would . The problem with Balls of Fury isn't exactly its jokes . They're funny enough , for the most part . It's the delivery . The actors have little ability in comic timing ( what halfway decent comedic director would willfully hire George Lopez to be in their movie ? ) , and Robert Ben Garant often fails to sell the jokes , even when they are potentially amusing . Even when the comic performances are good , as is the case with Walken and co-writer Thomas Lennon himself , the editing is so poor that the gags almost never hit . It's all quite maddening . Reno 911 is particularly brilliant in its editing . I really don't see how the same people could produce such a laughless comedy . I guess TV is just their medium , but I don't understand why film-making should prove so difficult for them .
Nonsensical	This is quite an awful film , directed by an allegedly famous Brazilian director , Paulo Cezar Saraceni , and starring several actors really popular in that country . To me , the direction seemed terribly amateurish ( the editing even moreso ) and the actors seemed too good to be acting in pornography . It is a biopic of Natal da Portela who established the first Samba School in Rio de Janeiro . After watching this film , I have only the vaguest notions of what a Samba School is ( those notions solely provided by the Q & A session after the film ) . The character presented on screen is different in every scene . The only character trait that was well established is that he had one arm . The film vaguely tells us how he lost his arm . The drama doesn't work , the comedy works even worse . At least there's some good music once in a while . It wants to be a musical , I think , but I don't think they could afford to make it one . I liked the documentary scenes of Carnival at the film's end . I doubt Americans will have many chances to see this film , anyways . If the chance arises , avoid it like the plague . The music is nice and there are some pretty colors . That's all . Rent Black Orpheus instead , I implore you ! .
Awful script mucks good idea	The idea of this was fun and promising : the new night guard at the natural history museum discovers that all the exhibits come to life at night . The previews were even actually amusing . Unfortunately , the script is just painfully awful . It sets up all these rules in this universe and doesn't even try to follow them . It commits the egregious crime of making veteran actors Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney , along with lesser known Bill Cobbs ( he was the magic janitor in The Hudsucker Proxy ) into villains , who , I might add , have little believable motivation for the things they do . What's really funny is that the screenwriters are Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant , who are the creators of the enormously funny television show ( and upcoming movie ) Reno 911 . They apparently slum writing for mainstream movies , and they must think very little of the audience . Their screen writing credits also include the masterpieces The Pacifier , Herbie : Fully Loaded , and Let's Go to Prison . I guess their underestimation must be on the money , though , as my movie-going companions seemed to enjoy it ( they were not children ; and children , for what it's worth , might actually like this okay ) , even through the dozens of plot inconsistencies ( so the wax Teddy Roosevelt isn't really Roosevelt , but Sacajawea is the real Sacajawea ? ) . The script is so bad , there are several loose ends that they forget to tie up , until the end credits , that is . But I was already heading fast for the door and couldn't be bothered to find out if they tidied everything up . Somehow I doubt it .
How to take advantage of your children's naivety for the sake of cold cash . . .	I have , in all my life as a lover of both literature and the cinema , hardly ever come upon a piece of work more unimaginative , more ugly , more uninteresting , more lacking in suspense , more lacking in charm , more greedy , more incoherent . . . Okay , okay . I'll stop with the superlative negatives . Surely there have been worse , and , yes , off the top of my head , I can think of many that are worse . However , for a book that over 125 million people have read , and for a movie that cemented the record for the biggest opening weekend in history , and also for a book that has had not only kids but critics singing its praises , and also for a movie which one particularly fat-headed critic called the Wizard of Oz of its generation , I am more than severely disappointed . I know that , had it not been so overhyped , it would have been just as bad . Now , however , my anger for it is completely hardened and it's going to be a passionate battle for me for years to come . I go into an in depth criticism , but it would be impossible for me to keep to 1000 words . There is hardly a piece of it that I liked . As a film , it was poorly edited , poorly acted ( by most ) , poorly filmed . The only really memorable scene is the troll in the bathroom , although the payoff to it makes no sense whatsoever . The Quidditch game , which has been hyped to all heaven , is completely boring and poorly created . It looks like the FX guys created it with photoshop . When the chess game looked like it was about to be the most exciting sequence in the film , Christopher Columbus , who , I must say , lives up to his reputation completely , begins to edit furiously . I heard afterwards that this was done to avoid a PG-13 . My immediate thought is that the filmmakers didn't trust their young audience to enjoy watching a chess game , no matter how exciting it might have been . I'm still not sure which story to buy . But the person I really want to tear into is J . K . Rowling . What a hack . Never has the word " hack " been more fitting . A former waitress , her idea of imagination is to call things by weird names . Only in the mind of a psychopath ( or idiot ) could the name Draco Malfoy or a Cerberus clone named Fluffy be considered clever . Writing children's literature is not difficult , but this is simply awful . She's clearly ripping off Raoul Dahl like there's no tomorrow , especially in the exposition . The game of Quidditch , which seems to be a drawing point of some sort , is absolutely nonsensical . As a preteen , I invented much more interesting games with much less interesting playing pieces . Quidditch is a game where people score ten points at a time , unless someone catches a special type of ball , which ends the game immediately . So theoretically , the game could end in thirty seconds . And all the other forms of scoring matter not at all . And let's talk about the surprise climax . Really , anyone could have been standing in front of that mirror at the end . It is tremendously unclever . And the penultimate sequence , where the crown is awarded to the best dorm , is anticlimactic and just rude to the children of Slytherin , We only hate one of them , so why should we be happy that the award at first goes to them , and then is cruelly snatched away . And what about Hogwart , anyways ? If you're not supposed to use magic when you're away from Hogwart , why the heck would you want to be a wizard anyways ? Friends , you're well on the path to making your children drooling morons . If they want a great series of books about sorcery and magic creatures , make them read the Chronicles of Narnia by C . S . Lewis . This is the most soulless garbage imaginable . And I thought Shrek had taken that title .
Just how many times can we sit through this same , tired story ?	Insufferable . Sure , it's autobiographical , but when your autobiography just reiterates the same story that we've seen in the movie theaters seven dozen times since Martin Scorsese made Mean Streets , why bother telling it ? The movie is about a young Italian man growing up in a tough New York neighborhood ( this time in Queens , but just as often in Brooklyn or the Bronx ? they seem pretty interchangeable in these movies ) who hangs out with his stupid but lovable friends and deals with his strict but loving father ( played here by Chazz Palminteri , big surprise ) and secretly wishes to get out of this hellhole . The tiny kernel that propels the story is a rival group of friends , here black , no surprise , that is challenging the Italians ' dominance . Blah blah blah . Christ . We also have part of the story taking place in present time , with a miscast and totally wasted Robert Downey Jr . playing the protagonist and trying to get his sick father , who has renounced his son , to go to the hospital . Blah blah blah . The film is a complete waste of talent and time . One of the worst of ' 06 .
One of the last films Willis O'Brien made , but it isn't a very good movie	Giant radioactive monsters , while apparently preferring Tokyo , do occasionally attack other major cities , whether they be San Francisco in It Came from Beneath the Sea , or London , as in this movie . This one , called the behemoth , I think is referred to as a plesiosaur but looks more apatosaurus-like . The Giant Behemoth , aka Behemoth the Sea Monster , is your average monster-attacks-city movie . It spends an inordinate amount of time on people jabbering along , scientists trying to figure out what gave dead people radiation burns , et cetera , et cetera . By the time I started nodding off , the monster makes his first appearance , and looks kind of like a piñata . Later it comes on land and is a stop-motion effect . This was Willis O'Brien's penultimate film . At this point , O'Brien and his techniques had been surpassed by those of his student , Ray Harryhausen . The behemoth looks not much better than the dinosaurs of the silent The Lost World . Still , I quite like it . There's just something about stop-motion effects that charms me . But these effects are too few and far between to make the movie worth anything .
Lame	This was kind of a test watch , the first film I watched through Netflix's instant watch option . I didn't expect this film to be that good , and I didn't want to waste a place in my queue for it . My instincts were correct about the film's quality . Bob Odenkirk , one of the funniest men who ever lived , hasn't had great success as a director . This film is unbelievably sloppy in both its script and its editing . I rarely notice editing mistakes , but they're rampant here . Everything would be forgiven , of course , if the film were funny . The Brothers Solomon has its moments , but , in general , it's lame . Will Arnet and Will Forte play too socially stunted brothers who want to have a baby before their coma-afflicted father passes . After failing to land women who would willingly have their children , they find a woman ( Kristen Wiig ) who is willing to do it for money . I can come up with a lot of things wrong with this picture . For example , Will Arnet is too much of an alpha male type to play a hopeless loser . Plus , as that alpha male type , he's better suited to jerk roles . It can be hard , if not impossible , to root for him . And Forte is funny enough on Saturday Night Live , but he never stood out . He comes off as weaker than Arnet , and , even if I'm not laughing at Arnet , he ends up burying Forte . Wiig is usually a pretty funny gal , but she's cast here as the straight man . The only actor who consistently gets laughs is Chi McBride as Wiig's enormous African American boyfriend with a foul mouth . Swears may be cheap laughs , but when watching a comedy with a dearth of laughs , I'll take the cheap ones .
Trite and clichéd , featuring the most annoyingly perfect family since the Osmands	This started out kind of charming . Not great , because from the first moment everything seems pretty clichéd , but charming nonetheless . But as it moved on , the clichés and contrivances started to become overwhelming . The story involves a widower ( Steve Carell ) with three daughters who , while visiting his parents in Rhode Island , meets a woman ( Juliette Binoche ) in a book store . They hang out for a few hours , talk , get to know each other . But she's in a relationship . Turns out , predictably , that it's his brother's girlfriend , and she's with him at their parents ' house during some family reunion or something . Every subsequent scene involves the two would-be lovers being pushed together , whether they are playing hide-and-seek , doing aerobics , or taking a shower . It's never funny , and it becomes lamer each time . But if it were only this , the film would still be acceptable . Steve Carell is , of course , fantastic at playing chagrin , and he's so effortlessly lovable . Juliette Binoche has certainly started to show her age , but she's good and still attractive . It's really the whole family thing that drove me crazy . This is seriously the most loving family in human history . They hang together , have fun , and constantly play games with each other , whether it's competitive crosswords , charades , bowling , or , God help me , a family talent show . What kind of family has a family talent show ? Jesus Christ ! Sorry , maybe I'm just lamenting my own semi-dysfunctional family , but I'd say we were not that far below the curve . To spend time with this family would be about as oppressive as having ex-cons and sexual abusers in the family . It made me want to re-watch Baumbach's Margot at the Wedding just to get a breath of fresh air ! Honestly , the movie's not that bad , but my purely subjective reaction was that it was insufferable !
John Wayne cheapie	Not bad , just incredibly dull . Wayne and partner Lane Chandler try to start a stagecoach route through a ghost town . A rival stagecoach company tries to stop them . Some of the stuff near the beginning of the film is okay , and the lead actress is cute and looks a bit like Ginger Rogers . The final action sequence put me to sleep . .
God help us !	I think this was made for HBO during a time of huge scandals in televangelism . It has the same consistency of an HBO movie : unsubtle , poorly acted , and generic . It's not a bad movie , especially for that origin . However , when a director like Anderson has directed it , I expected a little better . The direction is so bad , though , it's truly , truly embarrassing . The film is about a failing evangelist who hires a sexy singer to spice up his services . She steals the show from him . I don't know , I couldn't finish it . Like I said , it's not awful , but I just figured that life was too short to watch something so unaccomplished . Plus , Christian rock , which is abundant in the film , is the second worst genre of music on the planet , right after Christian ska . P . S . If you're looking for this , it actually has been on VHS before , despite what previous comments have said . Orion put it out . I found it in my library system . But , really , you don't want to see this , at least if you're a fan of Lindsay Anderson . Only if you're a completist , but it's just an embarrassment .
Not good , but with a couple of points of interest	Lame musical comedy starring Esther Williams and Ricardo Montalbahn . Williams plays a bathing suit designer who wants to protect her sister , Betty Garrett , from Montalbahn , a polo star and Lothario whom Garrett has fallen for . Really , though , Garrett has fallen for Red Skelton , who pretends to be Montalbahn . While Williams thinks she's keeping Montalbahn occupied , the two , as you expect , fall in love . Williams is a pretty boring actress , famously only " something " when she's wet , and she's kept out of the water for 95 % of the movie , and they even cut away from what promises to be an epic water ballet in the final moments . The only amusing moments come between Skelton and Garrett , though their antics never rise above slightly amusing . They have good chemistry , though . It's too bad their studio didn't recognize it at the time , because they should have been paired again . There are two bits of interest in the film : first , it won the Oscar for best song , Frank Loesser's " Baby , It's Cold Outside " . Now there's a trivia question ! The song doesn't even make sense in the movie . As far as I could tell , the movie takes place in California . Even if I'm incorrect on that , it certainly was never cold in the movie , and why would someone even write a song about the cold and snowstorms for an Esther Williams movie ? Weird . It's a great song , of course , and the best part of the film . Both couples sing it in full back to back , with Garrett and Skelton reversing the roles the second time around . The second thing , there's this one character in the movie named Pancho , who works for the polo team or something . When he began to talk , I was thinking , " Wow , what a stereotypical accent . Sounds just like Speedy Gonzales . " Then , " Wow , really a lot like Speedy Gonzales . Wait a second ? that actor looks like ? " Yes , it was ! Mel Blanc , playing a guy who sounds just like Speedy Gonzales . I didn't know Mel Blanc did anything live action .
Awful movie , but nice songs	By all rights , a terrible , wicked movie . The Gospel According to Hippies , hippies played by several extraordinarily attractive young people who make cute faces and speak in cute voices . This film is proof that the late 60s and early 70s were the root of the current hyperactivity problem . Watching this film is like seeing ADHD getting invented before your eyes . Also , what's with David Haskell ? He plays John the Baptist , later turns into Judas Iscariot , and is obviously made up to look like the traditional Jesus . Why so confusing ? And I hope this doesn't spoil anyone's fun , but John the Baptist gets decapitated and Judas hangs himself in the Book , but Mr . Haskell gets to live on until the end . Look , I'm no Christian , but I can feel the power that exists in the story of Christ . Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to Matthew , the definitive film adapted from the Bible , brought me to tears . Godspell effectively sits on the Holy Book and flatulates for an hour and forty minutes . You could not imagine a less respectful adaptation . Yet , I couldn't totally hate this movie . It does pull itself together for its final twenty minutes or so , and rediscovers some of the power in the original writings . It's also a musical , and , as a musical , it contains some great songs . I'd say that there really are only a handful of movie musicals with really amazing songs , and Godspell is one of them . In the end , a .
French award bait that's pretty poorly written ( though , I admit , well performed )	You've got to be kidding me ! If this were an American film , it would be dismissed outright by many as Oscar bait . As it is now , it should be dismissed as Cesar bait . I think , if it were a French language film without the stunt casting of a famous English actress , it would also be dismissed . Anyhow , the point is , it should be dismissed . It's just not that good of a film . Yes , Kristen Scott Thomas is quite good as a woman recently released from prison after a 15 year stint . Elsa Zylberstein , playing the little sister who was forced by her parents to forget about Thomas , is actually quite a bit better . But , yeah , between those two , the film doesn't lack in the acting department . But the script ! Oh , the script ! The film would be good or great if it were all about the relationship between the two sisters . It's definitely at its best when it concentrates on relationships . The screenplay is so awful , though . Claudel writes it as an ongoing mystery . First it's " Where has this woman been ? " That lasts for about ten minutes . After that the mystery is , " What has she done ? " This is left untold for about thirty minutes . And then comes the big one , " Why ? " They keep that one covered up for the rest of the film . But that's pretty much the only thing you think about for ninety minutes . Even when the characters are growing , it's hard to care about anything else . I mean , after all , that " why " is going to go a long way toward understanding Thomas ' character . The fact is , when you do actually find out " why " , it's extremely dumb , as well as completely unbelievable . But I would have been bothered even if Thomas ' " why " had been good . The structure of the film is rather annoying . By the end , the film feels like a complete waste .
Pretty bad movie	You'd think a film with Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington would be a pretty good one , right ? Well , I know there are plenty of people who hate Tom Hanks , and I was one of them for a long time . Philadephia was actually why I hated Tom Hanks . People are right to call this movie propagandistic , although several of the commenters below are glaring homophobes ( what many others don't realize is that propaganda is important , and that most people believe what they believe through propaganda ) . What I have not seen anyone mention is how terribly homophobic this movie is . I can't believe intelligent people like Jason Robards , Tom Hanks , and Denzel Washington would ever lend their names to Philadelphia , let alone accept an Oscar because of it . I'm talking about two scenes in particular : the scene where we see Tom Hanks contract AIDS ( by having sex in a gay porno theater with the man who is sitting next to him ) and by having Hanks's character bring Washington to a homosexual party where everyone is dressed in drag . Philadelphia is basically telling the majority of its viewers that , while homosexuals may deserve rights , they are still icky people who do weird things to get their kicks .
Not bad for a video game adaptation , but not good for a movie	About the best that can be said of this movie is that it's hardly the worst film that's ever been made out of a video game . Then again , it pretty much throws the game to the wind anyway . Max Payne was one of the first games of the Playstation 2 system , and , well , it would be giving it too much credit to say that it revolutionized storytelling within a video game . It at least tried to be cinematic in a way that no game up to that point ( 2001 ) had tried to be . It was pretty much a video game noir , complete with its own hardboiled dialogue . The film would have been wise to keep that aspect of the game . It might then have been fun . As it is now , it's a dismal , depressing revenge drama . Mark Wahlberg plays the titular ex-cop who is seeking clues to his wife and child's murder . His investigations lead him to a corporation that has developed a new drug , Valkyr , which gives humans almost god-like power ( in the game I remember it caused you to go into Matrix-style bullet-time physics ) . I guess it's not half bad as a revenge drama , but I always find myself wishing that that didn't even exist as a genre . According to Homer Simpson , revenge fantasies are one of the most common gifts Hollywood gives us . The look of the film is quite excellent , and it looks especially great on Blu Ray . Mila Kunis is sexy as a woman Wahlberg hooks up with , and who is also out for revenge . Recent Bond girl Olga Kurlyenko also appears ( in at least her second video game adaptation , following Hit-man ) ? most Bond girls quickly disappear into the Playboys of history , but I really like this chick . Mostly sexually , but she's not a bad actress . I kind of hope she sticks around for a while .
Total crap	Only slightly less bad than the original . The story is a little better , I suppose , and it adds a couple of amusing characters . Antonio Banderas would be the highlight as Puss In Boots , but he doesn't have nearly enough screen time . My favorite character was Jennifer Saunders as the villain , the Fairy Godmother . After that , though , the movie just sucks . How many dated jokes can they fit into one movie ? Let's see , we have the ' Are we there yet ? ' gag , which The Simpsons made old in 1990 . The ripples in liquid , which was done a million times the year after Jurassic Park came out . Is it really still funny 11 years later ? In the first Shrek there were Macarena jokes , long after that song was forgotten . Here , we end with Ricky Martin's ' Livin ' la Vita Loca ' which was old and annoying before the original film even hit the theaters . And then there's a bunch of disgusting fart and snot jokes that even cheaply produced television shows would reject as too tasteless . The abundance of C-grade pop songs makes the film even more dreadful . I mean , what happened to Counting Crows ? Their first two albums were great , and now they're doing one of the cheesiest love songs I've ever heard for this piece of garbage . And , worst of all , the animation is awful ! Characters move around jerkily and there's little or no attention paid to physics . Just take a look at Pixar's The Incredibles to see the difference . Seriously , if Shrek 2 beats out The Incredibles for the Oscar this year , as the original beat out the far superior Monsters Inc . , I will be as sad as I was at the results of the recent presidential election . .
Last Lambada in London	This is a huge misfire by a great director . In fact , I have seen many , many Malle films and have given four of them 10s , two 9s , and an 8 . That's a great average now brought down considerably by the 5 I'm giving this film . And , truth be told , it isn't a bad film . It's just uneventful . A movie about a man who falls in love with his son's fiancee just isn't all that shocking , at least in the movies . It might have worked if the characters were better developed . Anna ( Juliette Binoche ) is given a compelling background story , but it is not well used by the script , the direction , or the actress . And it pains me to say so , because I am in LOVE with Juliette Binoche . Stephen , the main character , played by Jeremy Irons , is even less well off . We learn nothing at all about him . His lust comes about almost immediate ( which isn't hard to understand : we're talking about BINOCHE here ) , but we are not given any real reason to believe that he would so quickly betray his son and his wife . Martyn ( Rupert Graves ) is the cuckolded son . He has a nice speech about the disappointments he had as a rich child , but that isn't enough to give his character any weight . Slightly better off is Miranda Richardson as Ingrid , Stephen's bored wife . She plays her upper class fears well as she has to deal with the newcomer Anna , who seems suspicious to her . She also has a good scene at the end when she confronts her husband . The one character whom I did find interesting is Sally , the teenage daughter . Through the film , she silently develops and loses a relationship with a boy . It is almost a parody of the seriousness of the two older men's relationship with Anna . We see Sally and her new boyfriend several times together , but he always has headphones on and they never talk to each other ( the adults never seem to talk to their lovers , either ) . Surely , if some more tension had been injected into the mix , or just anything else to get the audience to think about something , it could have been good . As it is , it's a dud . Instead , see some of its precursors : especially Last Tango in Paris , which is the kind of movie that can draw you in . I'd even suggest these two exploitation flicks as alternatives : In the Realm of the Senses ( Japanese : Ai no corrida ) and The Night Porter ( which I think is either a French or Italian film , but I happened to have seen it dubbed into English ) . Those films have the ability to entertain you a little , unlike Damage .
Dull beyond belief	I didn't think I could be so bored by a martial arts film . How disappointing ; I was looking forward to finally seeing a film by the legendary director King Hu , but this may turn me off any other films of his . The story is a dull one about a fugitive girl , an expert in martial arts taught by some powerful monks , who moves into a small town hoping to escape her death sentence . Her father had spoken out against a local tyrant , and his whole family was sentenced to death . An artist neighbor of the girl falls for her , and gets mixed up in the dangers she faces . The martial arts sequences are few and far between in this 3 hours + film , and the ones that are there are mostly poor . The editing is so choppy that it's often impossible to tell what's going on . Worse yet , a good number of these sequences are at night , so you can't see anything . Only the two climactic battles ( the film is split in two ) are any good at all , and they are kind of similar , at that . The only commendable aspect of the film is its gorgeous color cinematography . It is truly exceptional , but nothing else about A Touch of Zen is . Think me a rube or what have you , but nothing but pseudo-profundity and a lack of technical knowledge .
A fairly disappointing picture from Ray	It starts out well enough , with a recent college graduate ( Pradip Mukherjee ) desperate for work . The montage of his looking for work is great , especially a scene where he is interviewed for a job and asked the most irrelevant questions imaginable , including " How much does the moon weigh ? " He looks at the interviewer in disbelief . " What does that have to do with the job ? " " I'll ask the questions here , son ! " After several months of unemployment , he runs into an old friend who sets him up as a " middleman , " where he can make a huge profit with very little effort . It's immoral , and Mukherjee can feel his soul slipping away . But he can't quit , because he doesn't want to disappoint his elderly father ( Satya Bandyopadhyay , who gives the film's best performance ) . The main problem with the movie is that it's just too talky , and no one's talking about anything interesting . It wouldn't work if the characters were talking out loud about the moral dilemma ; that would make the film too obvious . But they just talk endlessly about how they are going to go about their business and so forth . The movie just drags on forever , and then it throws in this utterly contrived ending . Well , I was almost happy for the contrivance , because , although false , at least it didn't involve endless prattle . It's quite overlong . I miss the economy of his better films . A dud by a master . .
It aims to be ridiculous , but , even knowing that , I couldn't quite bring myself to like it	Hmm . What to say about this one ? Well , if you're the type that thinks action movies like Die Hard 4 are way too realistic , then Shoot ' Em Up might be for you . I mean , it is an action comedy , so you're definitely not supposed to take it seriously . When all kinds of crazy , physically impossible things happen , we're suppose to laugh them off . There's so much cringeworthy stuff in it . Like Clive Owen's carrots , for instance . Bugs Bunny is referenced at one point , a ways into the film , but that's the only thing I could think of from the first moment . The film declares itself a ridiculous cartoon from the first shot , where Owen is seen crunching on a carrot . And then he shoves it through the back of someone's skull . Yeah . The one-liners here ( yes , he does say " Eat your vegetables " when he snuffs the guy with the carrot ) are the worst I've heard since Arnie's Running Man ( " He had to spleet " ) . The plot is so ridiculous that even the slightest thought makes it crumble to pieces . And characters decode impossibly complex mysteries without a second's thought , reminding me of Batman's ball-point banana . " It can be nothing else . " If you can get on the film's wavelength , it's probably quite possible to like or even love this movie ( see Roger Ebert's 3 . 5 star review of it , for example ) . I just couldn't quite get with it .
" Fear the unrelenting wrath of the Buddha ! "	It's always cool to see rare , barely seen films from famous directors . This one is Fritz Lang's take on M . Butterfly ( a story ( a novel ? a play ? ) with which I am unfamiliar ) , about a Japanese woman who marries a European man , only to be abandoned by him , poor and pregnant . The story of the film is very good and should have made a better film . Unfortunately , Lang's direction is very unimpressive and plodding . The actors , too are poor , except for Lil Dangover as the Japanese woman , who is merely adequate . It reeks of early directorial effort . It's definitely worth seeing if you get the chance , if only as a curio . . PS : the quotation I cited in the summary above is actually spoken in the film by a Buddhist monk who wants to destroy the Japanese woman . Can you think of any god more intimidating than the Buddha ? I know I can't .
Frustrating	Oh , it's a good picture , but , well , it is just hairs away from being a great film . Actually , a lot of hairs . They're all small , individual problems , but there are tons of ' em . Just some small changes in the script , ones that wouldn't have been too difficult to make , and it could have been a Hollywood classic . Ginger Rogers won an Academy Award for Best Actress for playing the title character , a Philadephian of a modest , Irish upbringing . Did she deserve it ? I can't be fair in the matter . I'm totally in love with Ginger Rogers . However , in my opinion , this isn't one of her more memorable performances . She's good , to be sure , but I guess that she's not great for a melodramatic role . Basically , she won it because she died her trademark blonde locks red , akin to John Wayne wearing an eye patch in True Grit . Symbolically , that is , an actress who is perceived to play the same part time and time again went to a different genre . I hate to say that , because , as I said , I LOVE Rogers . I just worship her . I think it's horribly unfortunate that audiences , critics , and even actors themselves cannot accept comedic talent as equal to dramatic talent . I think that a comedic performer has a much , much more difficult job than his or her dramatic counterpart . Drama is easy in comparison . And who besides Ginger Rogers could dance like Ginger Rogers ? Take a look at the musical actresses of the 1950s , to compare : Leslie Caron , Debbie Reynolds , Cyd Charisse . All great . I'd never say anything different . But they're no Ginger Rogers . They all let Gene Kelly do all the work ( Jerry the mouse has more to do than they do ) , whereas Rogers " did everything that [ Fred Astaire ] did , except backwards and in high heels . " Everyone knows that Rogers was amazing in the RKO musicals of the 1930s . That's where you know Rogers from , and that's the direction from which I arrived at this film . However , I've seen at least one non-musical role that could be helpful here , very much so : Stage Door from 1937 . It's about a boarding house for actresses , starring Katherine Hepburn , but there are many other great actresses involved , including Rogers , who is the second most important character in the film . She is enormously quick-witted in that film , sassy and brassy to the extreme , but she also has a lot of choice dramatic scenes in which she is great . Let's talk about Kitty Foyle now . I love the structure : On the same day , Kitty's confronted by her two suitors , both proposing , Wynn , a Philadephia millionaire , and Mark , a doctor ( yes , you read that right : Kitty has to suffer the pulls between a millionaire and a doctor , the poor thing ) . As she stands around trying to make her decision , she begins debating inwardly ( actually , debating with her reflection in the mirror , which is pretty ingenious for the time ) . The whole film is constructed in flashbacks , a year before Citizen Kane . It also uses a snow globe symbolically , which is now getting spooky , a snow globe with a little girl on a sleigh in it . And it's an RKO film . I must be on to something ! Were Welles and Mankiewicz making fun of this ? Onward . The film actually uses symbolism decently , but it can never solidify the abstractions that the symbolism raises satisfactorily . Flowers , a specific type of alcohol , perfume , presidential elections , children . They work metonymically , which means that we're reminded of a previous scene in which , say , that particular type of alcohol is ordered . Sometimes it works , often it doesn't . Maybe when it doesn't , it's because the script ( by Dalton Trumbo , but it was also a novel first , which is probably the source of the symbolism ) uses it too often . The film's biggest problem is that it goes overboard with its melodrama too often . Scenes grow silly . Take the scene where Wynn , seeing Kitty for the first time in a long while , hires an orchestra to play until 5 AM so that they can dance alone ( and not Astaire and Rogers dance , mind you ! ) . If that weren't silly enough , when he is kicked out of the orchestra hall , he hires the orchestra to come to Kitty's appartment to play there ! There's even a scene where Wynn has to argue with the hotel clerk about it , promising him that the orchestra won't wake anybody ! Another scene that should have been great but faltered is one where ( SPOILERS ) Kitty runs into Wynn's new wife and son ( Kitty's own son by him was stillborn after she annulled their marriage ) . The son , who should be hers , forgets his toy and has to come back . Kitty has a conversation with him that should be enormously touching , but , for God's sake , is that kid a terrible actor ! My Lord , he completely craps on the scene . To make the film a bit harder to take , the rival for her love is despicable . In another cringeworthy scene , Kitty pushes the burglar alarm in the department store where she works instead of the stock call button ( seriously , they're RIGHT NEXT to each other ; whoever designed the system should be hit with a bat ! ) . In order to avoid getting fired , a friend tells her to pretend to faint , something that I couldn't understand . The doctor who comes to help her is Mark , and he realizes that she is faking it ( apparently he can tell why , too ) . He demands that she go out with him or he'll tell on her . When she refuses , he threatens ( joking ) that he'll prick her with a syringe if she doesn't agree . Jeeze , and some people have a problem at Fred Astaire's ploys to get Rogers ! When he shows up for the date , he keeps her in her apartment , telling her he has no money to take her out . When he reveals that he was lying , the reason is because he wants to make sure his dates aren't gold-diggers . He must have seen Gold-Diggers of 1933 , too , where Rogers sings " I'm into Money " with paper coins attached to her costume ! Luckily , Mark has enough of what it takes to get along . .
Betty Garrett and a few choice numbers make this a decent musical	Not one of the great musicals of the classic era , to be sure , but a fairly enjoyable one . The plot is nothing special , with Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra as ball players both smitten by their new owner , Esther Williams . Another woman , Betty Garrett , shows up about midway through the picture so each of our stars can have a girl . Much like in On the Town , a film made later the same year with Sinatra and Kelly , Garrett steals the show . If she had shown up a tad earlier , it might have been an even better movie . Besides Garrett , what makes the film worth watching are the musical numbers . Not all of them are memorable , but a few are , notably " It's Fate " as sung by Garrett . " Strictly USA " and " O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg " are also very good .
Certainly one of Miike's lesser films	Even if , in the future , he becomes the world's most beloved director and everyone everywhere seeks out all his films , Andromedia will be forgotten . There's really no such thing as " typical Miike " , but this film is somehow definitely atypical Miike . It's a teeny cyber-thriller that stars not one , but two Japanese teen pop groups , Speed and Da Pump , both of which get a song . Da Pump , the boy band , even gets their own music video in the middle of the movie for no good reason . So , yeah , it's kind of corny , but it's corny in a fun way . And it's just fun to see Miike do this kind of pap . The film's villains ? whose motives we never really understand ? are goofy and entertaining , especially Christopher Doyle , best know as the cinematographer of Zhang Yimou's Hero , who plays a shorts-wearing evil corporate guy from Detroit . He looks like he was downloaded from the mid-80s . Doyle even gets to dance during Da Pump's big musical number . So Andromedia's not half bad if you can take a bit of goofiness .
Marilyn is pretty good , as are the jokes about Bogie and Bacall	In this film , three women , played by three huge stars , Lauren Bacall , Marilyn Monroe , and Betty Grable , move in together with the plan to each land a millionaire . They each get involved with millionaires , but men of more humble means ( and at least one man pretending to be ) end up winning them over in the end . It's kind of lackluster , but it's moderately entertaining . It probably should have been funnier . The only real humor comes from Monroe , who needs glasses but is afraid no man will find her attractive when she's wearing them . She stumbles around bumping into walls and mistaking people's identities . There are also a lot of great in-jokes about Bacall's marriage to Humphrey Bogart . In the film , the millionaire whom she dates is played by the great actor William Powell , who was in his early sixties when the film was made . When he tells Bacall that he's too old for her , she tells him how she adores older men . " You know that old fella from The African Queen . I love that guy ! " Betty Grable is pretty forgettable , but , then again , I never found her particularly talented or attractive . She's pretty average on both fronts , as far as I'm concerned . The film is also interesting as an early example of the use of widescreen ( supposedly it was the first film in that format ) . It was developed in 1953 so that cinemas would have an extra draw , as television was destroying the industry . I watched a cropped version , unfortunately , but I think I did a decent job reconstructing how shots were originally composed . The opening and closing scenes are the most interesting . For no other reason than to demonstrate the new format , the screen encompasses an entire orchestra . The word " Cinemascope " appears enormously both at the beginning and at end . .
Rather flawed , but entertaining	Woody Allen's Shadows and Fog is just play . It's a comic take on German Expressionist filmmaking , like Fritz Lang's M , and other German art , especially Kafka's The Trial . Woody Allen plays a K-like character who is woken up by a lynch mob who want his help in capturing a serial killer , but they never tell him exactly what they want him to do . Mia Farrow plays a circus sword swallower who's fed up with her husband ( John Malkovich ) . The story is kind of random , half of it following Allen , who ends up being suspected of the murders , and the other half following Farrow , who ends up sleeping with a man ( John Cusack ) for the extravagant sum of $700 . The story ends up being disappointing , but it's fun . It's worth a watch . .
No , it's not based on the popular song by Kansas . . .	SLIGHT SPOILERSHou Hsiao-hsien is a filmmaker whose name has been dropped a thousand times in conversations I've had in the past year . Last week , I had a chance to see A Time to Live and a Time to Die . It was terrible . BUT , it was early in his career , and I was warned that many did not care for it . I can't imagine who would , but apparently there are some on the planet . And , to boot , not that many people had seen it . It is not available on video in the US . Those who alerted me to this filmmaker's existence were thoughtful and intelligent people , so I had no intention on giving up on Hsiao-hsien . This week , I got a chance to see Dust in the Wind . And I liked it . Now , it's nothing to write home about , but , this being , I think , the film he made right after ATtLaTtD , his maturation can be seen quite clearly . The script of Dust in the Wind is much better . When this film began , and I saw the aging but humorous grandfather , the injured and quiet father , and the harsh mother , I figured , oh hell , this Hsiao-hsien guy is such a poor writer that he can't even come up with a different family for his next film . The family of ATtLaTtD consisted of an old grandmother who supplied all the comic relief , a mother who was constantly disciplining her children , and a father who was dying of TB . The only difference in DitW was that the grandfather was actually amusing ; the grandmother in the earlier film was simply a nuisance . And , lo and behold , Hsiao-hsien ( and his editor ) had learned how to edit ! ATtLaTtD worked on the assumption that all a movie has to contain to be great is a multitude of long takes . A film can be good if it has a fondness for longer takes ( take a look at anything Andrei Tarkovsky's made ) , but I would say that only a pro should depend on them so heavily . We art-house patrons may like the occasional ten minute take , but those who know their stuff can tell when the director and editor were keeping the takes long simply because they have no imagination . Hollywood style editing has proven itself over and over again and , unless you are a Tarkovsky or an Ozu , forget it , bud . The first scene of DitW is made up of a couple of long takes of 1 ) a train pushing forward on the tracks ( about a three or four minute take ) and 2 ) of the two main characters standing in the train ( about a two minute take ) . The second scene , where grandpa attempts to feed the children , is edited with quick cuts , almost jump cuts , which suggests the old man's mounting frustrations with his disobedient grandchildren ( the way in which he gets one grandson to eat his dinner is classic ) . This is how editing works , and Hsiao-hsien has learned that . Now his ten minute takes are not a burden . They carry more weight . The film also contains its share of truly fantastic scenes , including those opening two that I referenced . Another one involves the two main characters , Wan ( the boy ) and Huen ( the girl ) , who are dependent on each other and call it love , at a bar with a bunch of friends . The emotions that play out in this scene are fantastic . Wan's friends convince Huen to take her first drink of beer , which she does in one huge gulp , followed closely by a second on her own accord . Then Hsiao-hsien cuts to a shot over Huen's shoulder . A space to her right is left open around the otherwise full table , and , from across the table , Han fills that gap . The shot lasts for some five minutes . Han is angry at Huen , and the emotions are broadcast marvelously , mostly by the way Han smokes , in this composition . The best scene in the movie involves Han's attempts to steal a moped . This was the only scene that truly affected me . At least one scene really bothered me . The visual style of this film is rather bland . And I don't mind that ; the genre is neorealism ( whether Hsiao-hsien knows that or not ; his debts to Vittorio de Sica and Satyajit Ray seem clear enough to me ) , and the visuals are supposed to look cheap ( because , well , these movies are made for very little money ) . For a film like this , when I say that a shot is well composed , like the bar scene I mentioned above , it is because it is composed in such a way to give the scene its maximum emotional weight . That shot was marvelous not because it was flashy , but because it seemed natural and it was miraculously economical . Now there comes a shot nearer the film's end , after Han is drafted into the army , in which two soldiers are shot at a high angle in silhouette as they stand on top of a hill , bluish storm clouds against a pinkish sky . In a film where naturalism is the goal of every composition , this particular shot stands out like a sore thumb . C'mon , Hou , if you want to emulate Ingmar Bergman , wait until your next film and then style your film in that manner ! It's a truly embarrassing shot . I've said nothing about the film's story . Suffice it to say , it is touching , but not too much so . Han is a well developed character , but I felt that I ought to have known Huen more . Her decision near the end of the film comes too quickly and at too great a distance from the action . The audience then has no choice but to make a bitter judgement on her character . We side solely with Han , when we it should be more ambiguous ; previously , they had been given rather equal footing in their developments . The final scene is quite beautiful , however , and leaves the audience feeling like they've witnessed something at least somewhat worthwhile . .
Interesting failure , but it looks beautiful	SPOILERSYou could tell that Agnes Varda had half of a great idea going into this film , but she never panned it out to its fullest extent . It begins interestingly enough , and progresses so for about half an hour or forty-five minutes . Then it plateaus and nothing very important comes of it . The story has a young married man , Francois , who is in a state of perfect happiness with his beautiful , down-to-earth wife and two beautiful young children ( these four are played by an actual married couple , the Drouots , and their children ) . On the job , Francois begins to run into a postal clerk named Emilie . He's attracted to her and thinks to himself , " Hey , I'm happy , but if I can make myself happier still , is there any harm ? " So he starts to date her without losing an iota of interest in his wife . SPOILERS . Eventually , he decides to tell his wife , and he does so guiltlessly . She seems to take it well , and the two make love in an idyllic , pastoral setting . After their lovemaking , Francois falls asleep . When he awakens , she has drowned herself ( apparently ) . Several months later , Francois and Emilie marry and she becomes a mother to the two children , working her hardest at taking the role . As the film ends , we realize that she has incorporated herself into the family perfectly and everything is back to normal . They will live happily ever after , or at least I didn't see any real foreshadowing of future tragedies . Now , my first instinct is to take the film as being slightly ironic . Wouldn't you think a woman director would want to satirize this man and his rather selfish attitude ? Perhaps Varda thinks that a lot of men feel that they should be able to , or at least could successfully love two women at once . There's never a hint that either Francois ' wife or Emilie would ever take another lover themselves . They are both absurdly selfless . Emilie totally accepts her position as the paramour . The wife does at first , of course , but it was only a lie so she could punish him . Even more ironic and unfair is that Francois only barely suffers from her death . Even their children seem wonderfully happy next to the indirect and direct causes of their mother's death . However , I'm fairly sure that the audience isn't supposed to hate Francois . In reality , it seems to me that Varda was trying to challenge social conventions and that she herself is asking why a man can't be perfectly happy loving two women . If this is the case , and it did seem so to me , I feel that Varda is just being a bit facetious . Francois is not a very believable character . He spouts some very ridiculous philosophy about why he should follow his heart and love both women . The audience , in fact , often laughed at these thoughts , because they were , in truth , silly . Francois , at times , seems absolutely naïve . Perhaps this is more support for my first interpretation . But if that were true , the movie still doesn't work . To satirize a kind of person , it's best to have them even remotely believable , which Francois , as I have stated , is not . Even if this film does fail in its narrative , it is still well worth seeing . It is perhaps best known for being Varda's first film in color . I saw an absolutely beautiful print : this woman knows how to use the format . It's all so vibrant ; the colors are not exaggerated , but they're composed in such a way that they stand out almost in three dimensions . And she uses these beautiful fades to green , red , blue , white , and so forth . .
Not great , but better than one might expect	I was in the mood for a horror flick , and the trailer to this one was quite spooky . I was pretty sure I could read through the advertisement to see the movie beneath , but I figured , eh , what the hell . Thankfully , while the movie doesn't quite match the eeriness of that preview , The Ruins is a moderately successful horror movie . It's not too stupid , and it delivers some good scares . Nothing to write home about , but it's pretty rare even to find a decent movie in this genre . The movie starts out pretty unremarkably , introducing us to a bunch of vapid college students on vacation in Mexico . They meet a German backpacker who asks them if they want to help him look for his brother , who went to visit an archaeological site and never came back . They arrive at the base of a pyramid , and a bunch of natives with guns and arrows drive them to the top , and then don't let them leave . Of course , there's something even worse than natives up there . Unlike most modern horror films , The Ruins doesn't reveal everything straight away . It allows us to see stuff moving in the background , but doesn't introduce us to the real danger until quite a way into the picture . The acting is a little better than this kind of movie usually has . The wonderful young actress Jena Malone is the biggest name , and was , in fact , the reason I finally decided to see the movie . Laura Ramsey is surprisingly excellent for an actress who began her career with the MTV " documentary " The Real Cancun . Jonathan Tucker and Shawn Ashmore play the two American men , and Joe Anderson the German backpacker . It does end poorly , but I enjoyed it .
Not as bad as I had thought it would be , but it's still basically a rip-off of The Land Before Time ( 1 )	To my amazement , I didn't find this movie reprehensible . I was actually moderately entertained by it . I saw it because of the eye candy ( and , at 82 minutes , I figured that , even if it was awful , I could last through it ) . I was expecting an awful script with awful voice actors spouting awful lines . That prejudgement was only 50 % true . The script wasn't awful , but it wasn't very good either . It was a lot like The Land Before Time without the compelling characters and adventure . I really liked that movie . It was a movie that I ( sort of ) grew up on ( I think it came out when I was 10 ) . There are even some shots in _ Dinosaur _ that seemed directly taken from The Land Before Time . The one thing that I was entirely correct about was the dialogue . Whew ! It stank . The jokes were especially at fault . The many children in the audience very rarely laughed . I think one kid laughed at the awfully silly word " jerkasaurus . " No one laughed at the " Love Monkey " joke , no one laughed at the obligatory " I've got a monkey on my back " joke . Luckily , the comic lines weren't that great in number . And there was only one lemur who was meant to be comical . Actually , the lemurs were the most interesting characters . Their designs and their characters were the most interesting in the film . Anyway , to sum up , you might want to see this in the theater because of the animation . It is truly remarkable . I don't think that dinosaurs work particularly well with it . The way they look when they make human gestures and facial expressions is kind of stupid . Disney wanted Dinosaurs simply because they're a perpetual source of interest for young children . Most of the kids who will really enjoy this movie have grown up after the Jurassic Park era . Dinosaur toys will be extremely easy to market . In fact , my favorite part of this movie was when the little kid across the aisle shouted " Look Daddy ! I have that toy ! It's Pleo ! " ( if you are an adult , you should wait to see this movie at a 9 : 00 PM show , because kids talk all through movies nowadays ; don't parents teach their kids that this is rude anymore ? I never was allowed to talk during movies when I was that young ) . This film might be a preview of the future of the computer animated movies , e . g . , the Final Fantasy movie that will open next summer . It is worth some money .
Not one of John Ford's best	Although The Quiet Man has traditionally had a place on the top of John Ford's career , I found it to be second , or maybe even third tier Ford . I've seen more than a dozen that I prefer to it , with only two that are on its low level , none really below ( however , I like them all ) . The story here is uninteresting . John Wayne moves to his homeland of Ireland from the U . S . , buys back his family home , and courts a young woman ( Maureen O'Hara ) . Her brother ( Victor McLaglen ) must approve of the marriage , but he refuses . Later in the film townspeople trick him into giving his siter to Wayne in marriage , which starts a bitter feud . The film is played for romance and comedy , and only moderately succeeds in both sectors . It begins very romantically , but as soon as O'Hara's part expands , she immediately becomes overbearing , annoying , and somewhat psychotic . I sure as hell wouldn't want anything to do with that woman . And John Wayne does little with his character . The role is underwritten , with a particularly flimsy backstory . Wayne is generally a very good actor in Ford's films , but he has little to do and , more or less , just stumbles through the entire film . He actually gets pretty mean to O'Hara late in the film , but I disliked her character so much that I almost approved of the scene where Wayne drags her over the landscape on her butt . The supporting cast has better luck . Barry Fitzgerald especially shines , and Ward Bond , Victor McLaglen , and many others whose names I didn't catch were good , too . Perhaps the best reason to watch the film is for the beautiful color cinematography . It catches the country of Ireland well . The music is also quite beautiful . Overall , The Quiet Man does have some great scenes , but there's generally little of interest happening . It's rather overlong at 2 hours and 9 minutes . A lot of other Ford films are more worthy , The Grapes of Wrath , My Darling Clementine , The Searchers , The Wagon Master , the list could go on for nearly a mile . The Quiet Man gets a , which is quite unimpressive for such a beloved film from such a wonderful director .
See it for Keenan Wynn , at the very least	Enjoyable final Thin Man film with Mr . and Mrs . Charles investigating the death of a jazz musician . Of the three Thin Man movies I've seen , I don't think I ever really was able to follow the convoluted mystery plots , not because they were beyond me , but because I didn't care much . I find them rather uninteresting . But William Powell and Myrna Loy are both so wonderful , and their chemistry so perfect that the films are never less than fun to watch . I enjoyed this one quite a bit , especially the jazz music that accompanies the plot . The supporting cast is excellent , especially Keenan Wynn , who gives a hilarious performance as a jive-talking clarinetist . It's very amusing watching Nick and Nora trying to understand his hip slang . Wynn is definitely the highlight of the picture . There are a lot of beautiful female co-stars as well , including Gloria Grahame , Patricia Morison , and Bess Flowers . .
Worth seeing , but I wish it were better than it is	Soderbergh is a director with a decent amount of guts but not a lot of talent . Here he attempts to make a classic Hollywood film , reminiscent of The Third Man and Casablanca , by mimicking , or at least trying to mimic , the classical style of cinematography , by scratching the negative , having the dialogue recorded on mono ( I think ) , and having the actors deliver performances along the lines of the studio days . The gimmick honestly doesn't work all that well . Lovers of classic films will notice how different the film-making is from that of the ' 40s . How hazy the cinematography is compared to Casablanca or The Third Man ( it looks like you're watching a movie on a black and white television ) . Or how much more swearing and sexual content there is in the film . Yes , the gimmick is a weak one and somewhat detrimental to the rest of the film . Otherwise , it's a pretty good mystery . Not a great one . The pacing lags in the middle , and the mystery only starts to make sense right near the end , when much of the audience has stopped caring . The film's strongest asset is Cate Blanchett , who channels Marlene Dietrich . She is easily one of today's best actresses , and the only cinematographic triumph of the film is the lighting of her face ? she's drop-dead beautiful . I'll probably be hung by the nostalgists , but I'd take her ? in both her acting skills and beauty ? over the lead actresses of Casablanca and The Third Man . George Clooney is decent , but his character is fairly two-dimensional . He's a pretty boring hero . I really liked Tobey Maguire , though . His character was much more interesting , and I wish he could have been in the movie more . I absolutely loved the climactic sequence , but the film continues on for too long after that . Blanchett's big revelation at the end feels rather anticlimactic .
Decent thriller ; nothing too special	Moderately entertaining thriller from Spain , from the director who would later make his English language debut with The Others , and whose 1997 film , Open Your Eyes , was remaid in Hollywood as Vanilla Sky . I would say it is obvious from Thesis , his Amenábar's first feature film , that he was aiming for a career in Hollywood . This movie could easily have been made in the USA . It's filmmaking is straightforward , the story is rather uncomplex , and its ways of generating tension and suspense are as hackneyed as anything made over here . The film is about two college students , Ana Torrent ( the little girl from Spirit of the Beehive ? surprisingly ugly as an adult ) and Fele Martínez , who discover that there is a ring of snuff filmmakers working at their school . Torrent is doing a report on violence in the media , and she meets Martínez because he is a connoisseur of violence and porn on film . Martínez is my favorite part of the film , because he is unattractive and nerdish . Most would find him difficult to trust in the real world , and any suspicion cast upon him would be difficult for most to refuse . Conversely , their main suspect ( Eduardo Noriega ) is extraordinarily handsome . Even though all the evidence seems to point towards him , Torrent can barely refrain from jumping his bones whenever he presents himself . Amenábar tries to make the audience unsure of which of these two characters did it , but anyone intelligent will figure it out instantly . The whodunit part of the movie is very weak . And I really didn't like the final bit , where the filmmakers desperately attempt to inject some substance concerning violence and the media . A news program which has newly acquired snuff tapes plans to show them live on television . While everyone will agree that the news media are extremely irresponsible when it comes to exploiting violence , this film is itself exploiting violence for that very same entertainment value . In no way is Thesis an anti-violence film . It gets plenty of thrills from making the audience listen to the girls in the snuff films shriek and so forth , once in a while even allowing us a peek at human guts being further torn asunder by a buzz-saw . To boot , snuff is a fiction invented by mystery writers and filmmakers specifically to avoid violence . No one has ever produced one that wasn't proven to be a complete fake . Enough bitching . If you're looking for an entertaining couple of hours , you could do a lot better , but you could also do a heck of a lot worse . .
Very difficult , with limited rewards ; possibly better upon repeat viewings	Possibly the most confusing movie I've ever sat through , it took me a long time to get anything out of it . I just couldn't grab onto even the slightest shred of a plot , and , without the ability to find a hook , it felt at first like watching a blank wall . But eventually , I started making inroads and , as the film progresses , its chopped-up plot begins to emerge . It is the story of a rapist and murderer and two women with whom he is intricately involved . Shino is one of his rape victims , and also , we find out , a woman he rescued from suicide in the past . Jinbo is the killer's wife , who knows his guilt ( or at least suspects it ) but loves him and wants to protect him . Nagisa Oshima actually went to film school in France , and , though part of the Japanese New Wave , no one will miss the French New Wave influences , especially Alain Resnais , whose films have similarly infuriated me in the past with their difficult narratives . Even if I never understood what the hell happened here , the film has several great aspects . The acting is quite good , that's clear . But , in particular , the music , by Hikaru Hayashi , and the cinematography , by Akira Takada , are extremely beautiful . I think I might like this one better if I give it yet another try .
Good but overrated biopic	SPOILERSIt's always inspiring to see someone overcome adversity like John Nash , the real-life hero of A Beautiful Mind . A brilliant mathematician , he suffered from sever paranoid schizophrenia for most of his adult life . But he learned to live with it , as normal a life as possible , and he ended up being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1994 . It's a great story . Too bad it's so generically told in Ron Howard's film . It's as by-the-numbers as a film like this can really get . The direction is bland , and the writing can be quite dull at times . Shine , for instance , is a much better film very similar in plot and structure . I must make an interjection in my own criticisms for this film , though . One reason why A Beautiful Mind may lack power is that it had some major points spoiled in the advertising . We don't actually know in the film , not until a long time in , that Nash is suffering delusions and fantasies . For instance , Ed Harris ' character is imaginary , which can be deduced almost instantly . But would I have assumed that if I didn't know what the film was about ? Can't be so sure . Anyhow , A Beautiful Mind is well worth seeing . The actors are pretty good . Russel Crowe may have given his best performance so far in the film . He won an Oscar last year for a rather lame role in Gladiator , but if he wins this year ( I write this the night before the Oscars air , by the way ) it will be very deserved . We've got an actor here who will continue to impress the hell out of us . Hopefully he can restrain himself from beating the crap out of people ( I think that it might cost him the award , but we'll see in approximately 24 hours ! An update : it did ) . Jennifer Connely is good , but she's been a lot better elsewhere , most notably in Dark City and Requiem for a Dream . It wouldn't be too out of line to award her , though . The rest of the awards it has been nominated for can vanish , for all I care . There's nothing special about Ron Howard's direction . It may be his best film , but that's a backhanded complement coming from me . The editing is plain . James Horner's score is particularly bad . It's far too overdramatic . The makeup is a possibility , though . Russel Crowe's old man makeup is quite good . I give the film a .
Omnibus film in the Neorealist vein	That was the intent , anyway . Cesare Zavattini produced the film and brought together five directors to make short films about love . The results are all good , but none of them great . They all have problems . To add to this problem , the version that I saw had English narration in the prologue and in the inter-segments , and sometimes in the short films themselves . I don't know if anything was edited out . Part 1 ( d . Dino Risi ) : This segment is a charming little film about the people in a dance hall . It has no real story . Instead , we see couples connect , people alone , and couples break up . It's very nice . Part 2 ( d . Michelangelo Antonioni ) : Of course , I saw the film for the Antonioni and Fellini segments . They're two of my very favorite filmmakers . Antonioni's is quite interesting . It is the most documentary-like segment . I don't know if it's true , but the narration claims that they gathered together a group of people who had attempted suicide over failed relationships . Two women tell their stories in an interview format . It's quite good . Part 3 ( d . Federico Fellini ) : At first , this looks like it will be the best of the film . The opening sequence , with the main character wandering through the narrow hallways of a Roman apartment building looking for a matrimonial service ( the equivalent of a dating service ) . A young child tells him that he will lead him to that room , and as they proceed , other children show up and follow them . That's a very mystical scene , but what follows is very disappointing . The man claims that he's looking for a wife for his friend , who happens to be a werewolf . This segment is the one that hints that there might have been some editing in the version that I watched . This man is introduced to the girl , they have a conversation in a field , and then the man , I guess , tells her that she is too good to do so . The result is nonsensical . There is absolutely no payoff . Actually , the weak ending reminds me a lot of the segment Fellini wrote for Roberto Rosselini's Paisa . Part 4 ( d . Mesallini Zavattini ) : I assume Zavattini is related to Cesare , probably his brother or son . Anyhow , this segment is most in-line with the neorealistic movement , which was dying by the time this film was made . A Sicilian woman went to Rome to find maid work . Her first employer impregnates her and then fires her . Now she's stuck with a young boy but no money whatsoever . She tries to scam a nanny into taking care of the kid , but he is eventually given back to her . There is a beautiful scene where the mother changes her sons diaper on the edge of a fountain . This scene's real-time realism is reminiscent of the maid's morning duties in Vittorio de Sica's Umberto D . , made shortly after this film and written by Cesare Zavattini . The climactic scene is truly heartbreaking , but the end is horribly anticlimactic . This film really shouldn't have had a happy ending . Neorealism and happy endings really don't mix . Part 5 ( d . Alberto Lattuada ) : Lattuada is most famous for co-directing with Fellini on his first film , Variety Lights . His segment in Love in the City is perhaps the best of the film . It has no story at all . Instead , it is a non-narrative compilation of the reactions of men when they see beautiful woman . The editing reminded me of Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia . It's quite musical . In fact , the music of this segment is really good . The film ends on a very poetic moment . All in all , you should see the film if you're a fan of Italian cinema , or just of Antonioni or Fellini . .
A movie made for teenage boys , so it'll do really well on IMDb	But , hell , while it's far from perfect , I'll admit that it's a lot of fun . Put it into the guilty pleasure category if you will . It goes for the title of violentest movie ever , and I think it succeeds . Much of the movie consists of the Spartan warriors hacking away at Persian fodder , with limbs flying everywhere , with an occasional head thrown in for good measure ( I was slightly disappointed that there were no entrails to be found ) . Sick as hell , yeah , but I think most of us have a little part of our brain left over from our uncivilized ancestry . Honestly , outside of the action sequences , the film is fairly worthless . The dialogue is overwrought and often embarrassing , with a heck of a lot of narration telling us about what it's like to be a Spartan . The exposition is lame ( except for maybe the prologue ? the part with the wolf was kind of cool ) . The trip to Thermopylae is dull , even when we find a tree with a hundred corpses impaled upon it . And , during the battle , whenever they show us what's happening in Sparta , I was always like , " Who the expletive deleted gives a expletive deleted ! Get back to the endless slaughter ! " The movie would have worked a hundred times better if it had just been 90 minutes of straight battle , with the only pauses being the tense , dark nights between them . So , really , the movie isn't all that great . But , hell , I have to give it my recommendation . Any movie that features a decapitated head spiraling through the air in slow motion has to be worth the price of admission .
A lot of fun ( SLIGHT SPOILERS )	The Fast and the Furious is not a great movie by any means , but it is very entertaining . It's definitely a turn - your - brain - off - for - two - hours flick , a nice popcorn flick . The plot is your basic undercover cop conflicted by his attachment to those he is infiltrating kind of thing . No real surprises here . The acting is quite good . I'm putting my money on Vin Diesel becoming the next Arnold Schwarzenegger . Michelle Rodriguez , who was just amazing in last year's Girlfight ( she is why I saw this film ) , is extremely sexy in it . Oh yeah , she gives a good performance , too . I hope she gets some great roles after the success of this movie . The other performers are all relatively good . There aren't any weak spots . The action , which is why most will see The Fast and the Furious , is very good . Although one might wonder why it takes five minutes , even in slow motion , for cars that go 150 + MPH , to travel a quarter of a mile , it doesn't hurt the flick too much . I generally don't like car chase movies . The Mad Max films and this are probably the only exceptions . I was clenching my teeth during several action sequences . .
entertaining , for the most part	Charley Varrick is a pretty good heist film . There are a lot of cliches , but there are even more original twists and turns . If you are a fan of the genre , then you will certainly like it . If you are not , then you will not . I myself don't care either way , and I just barely ended up liking it . MILD SPOILER : The only thing about the film that is particularly painful is the fact that Walter Matthau gets laid by a 20 year old woman . He is not the looker , and the sex scene is so ridiculous that they should have thought twice about filming it at all . It halts the picture in its tracks . Many will probably have to exit the room and vomit .
Terribly beautiful - terribly pretentious	It's impossible to love this film , and it is as impossible to hate it . The plot is slight and silly , and the dialogue and acting are unintentionally hilarious . Heart of Glass could stand as the archetype of the so-called " pretentious European cinema , " you know , the kind you would have seen Mike Meyers make fun of in his " Sprockets " sketches on SNL . In fact , I don't know of anything that comes even close to Heart of Glass in its pretentions . The film is as shallow as could be . Perhaps those with overactive imaginations could " figure it out , " but I don't want to waste that time . However , Herzog is an amazingly skilled director . The script may suck , but the visuals , the cinematography and the mise-en-scene , represent some of the greatest moments in all cinema . It's not a non-stop beauty festival , but there are many individual scenes of outrageous splendor . If only Herzog had planned the script as intricately as he searched out locations for the shoot . What this film really reminds me of an Andrei Tarkovsky or Michelangelo Antonioni film with no substance whatsoever . I can't give Heart of Glass more than a , but , in many ways , it's a must see . If you've never seen a Herzog film before , though , avoid this one . Start with Aguirre the Wrath of God or , my favorite so far , Fitzcarraldo .
Weak script , but very good acting	The narrative in this film is far too flawed . There are two intertwining halves of it , one good , one poor . The good one involves a woman , Ulla , whose husband died suddenly and unexpectedly one morning while he waited in his car to take their son to school . Now he gently haunts his family as they deal with the pain . The acting is magnificent here . Kieslowski is masterful at directing his actors in material like this , as he would show a million different times in The Decalogue , made a few years later . There are a few outrageously and subtly powerful scenes . Most memorable is the one where Ulla decides to prostitute herself to a British tourist . This happens about a month after her husband has died . After the man has sex with her , she asks him if he speaks Polish . He says no , and then she begins to talk about her problems in Polish . The other half of the plot is utterly weak in comparison . The husband was a lawyer , and the defendant in the case he was working on is screwed because of the death . The defendant's wife comes to Ulla for help , and though she is refused help at first , Ulla eventually introduces her to her husband's mentor , a cynical old man about to be kicked out of the business . Perhaps it's just my aversion to lawyer and courtroom dramas , but I just didn't care a lick what happened in this part of the plot . Supposedly it's meant as a criticism against the Communist law at the time . I don't know . It's dull whatever it is . But the film is slightly worth watching , especially for the acting . Even in the parts that I didn't care for , the acting is exquisite . .
Pretty much the same thing , but still fun	Roger Ebert , after giving Speed 2 a much-criticized 3 stars , ran a contest on his website : anyone who could come up with a way to make Speed 3 would get an autographed Speed 2 DVD from Ebert . I like to imagine that DVD sitting on the mantelpiece of either Neveldine or Taylor , the two men who came up with the wild Crank in 2006 . In it , Jason Statham plays a poisoned man . He will die quickly , but he can slow down the poison's progress by keeping his adrenaline pumping . The movie was way over-the-top , so much so that it's on a level almost of its own ( the underrated Paul Walker vehicle Running Scared is its only competition for the title of most over-the-top ) . People who saw Crank 1 might be surprised to see they came up with a sequel , giving this film's ending . But then again , maybe not . Neveldine / Taylor are so crazy and distrustful of logic that they probably didn't think twice about doing a sequel . They don't improve on their previous formula , truth be told . Crank 2 is pretty much the same thing as Crank 1 . It tries to go bigger , but it just can't feel fresh . But , like the first one , Crank 2 is quite a fun piece of crap . Statham's heart has been replaced with an artificial , battery-powered one . To keep it charged , he has to keep shocking himself . The best thing about Crank 2 is probably Bai Ling as a hooker who speaks broken , subtitled English . She's always a fun nutjob to have around . The film is chock full of goofy cameo appearances by the likes of David Carradine , Corey Haim , Geri Halliwell and Jenna Haze .
Overrated	Big disappointment . I've heard such great things about this French horror film , but it doesn't at all live up to them . Sure , it has its moments , but most of the time , it's fairly dull . An experimental surgeon ( Pierre Brasseur ) is trying to graft the faces of young women he kidnaps onto his daughter , who lost hers in a car accident . Alida Valli plays the assistant who carries out the kidnappings . The situation is definitely promising , but the film just plods along . Valli was never more bland , and Brasseur is weak , as well . The film only comes alive when Edith Scob , the daughter , appears . That mask , featured on the DVD cover , is very creepy itself . And when we actually see Scob's face , she's one of the most beautiful women imaginable . I like the fact that Franju gives us that pleasure halfway through the film , and then cruelly takes it away through a photo montage of the skin graft's deterioration . Which would be the best moment of the film , if not for the excellent ending . So I guess I kind of liked it . I only wish it were a lot better . If you get the Criterion DVD , make sure to watch the short The Blood of Beasts . It's better than the feature , though be warned : it's not for the easily queasified . .
Well worth watching just for Woody Harrelson	A rather forgettable mystery bolstered by a remarkable lead performance and some good supporting performances , as well . The lead is played by Woody Harrelson , in my mind one of the most undervalued actors of his generation . He plays Carter Page III , a dandy fop in Washington D . C . who spends his life escorting the wives of politicians to parties and functions that their husbands don't wish to attend . He accompanies Kristin Scott Thomas to her lover's apartment one day , and she finds him there dead . Harrelson protects Thomas from getting involved , but entangles himself in the investigation . And when he and his lover ( Moritz Bleibteu ) begin investigating on their own , they open a whole new can of worms . To me , the mystery seems pretty half-baked . I think , even at the end , I only kind of understood why the man was murdered . Director Schraeder is far more interested in the character of Carter Page III , but even when he dives headlong into character development , it can feel forced . It's mostly only because of Harrelson that the film works at all . I'd recommend the film solely for his performance . Also in the cast are Lauren Bacall , Lily Tomlin and Ned Beatty , but none of them are given all that much to do . Besides Harrelson , Thomas and Bleibtreu provide fine work .
Visually impressive , but I wasn't that interested in the story	I think it may be time for Zhang Yimou to give up the martial arts epic genre . Honestly , I think Hero was enough . I like his new film , Curse of the Golden Flower , about as much as House of Flying Daggers . It has its moments , and the design is absolutely fantastic , but it's not much after that . The story is one of court intrigue at the Forbidden City . Gong Li is the empress and Chow Yun Fat the emperor . She discovers that he is slowly poisoning her , and plans a coup . It takes forever for anything exciting to happen . Yeah , I love the action , I'll admit , but I would have been happy enough for a slightly more involving story . While the sets and costumes are outrageously beautiful to look at , the actual cinema isn't anything special . By the time the story does get going , it becomes a lot of fun . If you like violence , that is . If you're the kind of person to wonder how many of those soldiers and ninjas that got wasted had kids , this film probably isn't for you !
Slight but quite amusing	Not a great movie , but a delightful one . It's nice to see Disney playing with their own formula , even if it is with kids ' gloves . So many other films and TV series have ripped it apart quite meanly , but few have done it as well and as poignantly . Enchanted still wants to rely in the happily-ever-after thing in the end , but at least they acknowledge the real world here . The lead actor plays a divorce attorney , for instance . He's a single father , and for the longest time I was expecting the story of how he became a widower , but then it's revealed that his wife left him . And it's nice to see the traditional princess and damsel in distress , played by Amy Adams , become the hero during the climax . Adams is the main reason to watch . She's such a charmer . James Marsden is also quite funny as the prince who has come to rescue her , and Timothy Spall has a nice , hammy role similar to the one he also played in Sweeney Todd last year . And it's nice to see Susan Sarandon turn into a dragon . It's about time she revealed her true form to the world .
Hard to get through , but worth it	Whew ! I feel like I just climbed a mountain with this one ! This is certainly one of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's seminal works . I think it's key to understanding his worldview , and to understanding the director as a human being . After all , years before he made this movie , he named another character Franz Biberkopf , the hero of Fox and His Friends . Of course , Fassbinder himself , in the biggest acting role of his career , played Biberkopf in that film . I assume he must have seen himself in Alfred Döblin's protagonist . Having now watched Berlin Alexanderplatz , I find that extremely sad . The challenge of Berlin Alexanderplatz is not exactly its length ? heck , I've watched 24 episodes of Lost in half the time it took me to watch this series . It's the unpleasantness of the characters , particularly Franz Biberkopf . At the opening of the series , he is being released from prison after four years for beating his girlfriend to death in a rage . It's a moment we relive via flashback about a dozen more times in the next 15 hours , including at least one episode where it plays out twice and another where nearly the same scenario is played out with another woman . Biberkopf says he wants to stay clean from now on , but it only takes a short while before he's involved again with criminals . The main brunt of the story concerns Biberkopf's dealings with his new friend Reinhold , a gigolo and a burglar . There was never a moment in the series when I was thinking that Franz Biberkopf was at heart a good guy . No , he's a coward . He's a jerk . He's a big fat baby . Fassdbinder asks us to feel for him almost constantly . Even if he was being ironic , and I don't think he was , I couldn't appreciate that . I knew from the start that things were going to end badly . Even worse , about halfway through the series , Franz's eternal protectress , Eva , throws him a bone in the form of a young innocent named Sonia . Immediately , Franz says , " You don't look like a Sonia . I'm going to rename you Mieze . " And he treats women that shabbily throughout the film , though Mieze is the last one . As soon as such a sweet and innocent character enters the picture , I knew she was bound to end up dead . To add to these often painfully ugly characters , Fassbinder also likes to make the series purposefully annoying with grainy photography and a cacophonous musical score . There are far too many scenes of endless dialogue , often so esoteric that it becomes meaningless babble ( this is supposedly part of the point of Döbin's novel , but I never felt the point was made that well in this series ) . In short , Fassbinder wants to make this series torture to sit through . And the two hour epilogue , which enters Biberkopf's dementia-ridden mind , feels so much different from the strict realism of the rest of the series that it feels like a miscalculation . So it's a difficult watch , to be sure . But I do think it's a good series overall . Like I said , it provides valuable insights into Fassbinder's character . The cinematic prowess of the director is also on full display most of the time . Best of all , if you're one who loves great acting , you very well might experience some bits of heaven amidst the ordeal . Günter Lamprecht leads the cast , and is simply amazing . Gottfried John is Reinhold , Barbara Sukowa is Mieze and Hannah Schygulla is Eva . Franz Buchreiser plays Meck , who begins the series as Franz's closest friend and then is shoved away , has the only moment in the series that made me feel deeply for any of the characters . This was one of my longest-awaited viewings . It was a disappointment , overall , but it was worth my time .
Interesting obscurity from Japan , on DVD from the good people at Artsmagic	There's so much obscure Japanese cinema that I long to see . Thank God for niche suppliers like Tokyo Shock and Artsmagic . The latter has resurrected a five film series of Nikkatsu pink films entitled Angel Guts . High School Co-ed is the first of these films , all of which center around a brutal act of rape , around which a moral tale unfolds . This one has a group of three bikers who attack young women . One of them , Kawashima , has a small bit of conscious , though . Outside of his friends , he lives for his young sister and realizes that the violence he and his friends enact upon others could just as easily be applied to her . While I've seen more graphic material before , the actual rape scenes are very disturbing . The artistic merit is certainly questionable , and the acts are played for stimulation . However , the script is very good , and the characters come across as people . There is at least one character whose situation is only hinted at and never explained ? I would have liked to know more about him . And the ending is very odd . Otherwise , definitely a film of interest , if not for those who are easily shocked .
Great performance by Dvorak , and a great ending . Awful kid .	This probably mostly gets watched by Bette Davis or Humphrey Bogart completists . But , while Bette Davis is one of the titular three smokers , her role is relatively minor . Bogart plays the typical gangster he played so many times before The Maltese Falcon . The stars of this film are Ann Dvorak and Joan Blondell . The story is about former classmates who meet again as adults . Dvorak grew up a goody-two-shoes who was always secretly jealous of the more popular troublemaker Blondell . Blondell has had a bad life , been in a reform institution and hangs out with gangsters . Dvorak , on the other hand , went to college and is raising a son with her high-powered attorney husband . When the two meet again , Dvorak is still jealous of Blondell's exciting lifestyle . She's bored with her husband , and ends up leaving him . Blondell tries to save her by going to her husband , but that plans goes awry when the husband falls for Blondell . The two women basically exchange lives , and Dvorak goes through Hell . I have to admit , the main reason this movie is memorable is because of the gasp-inducing ending . It's just one of the most shocking things I've ever seen in a classic movie . The story is pretty good , and Dvorak in particular is excellent . The thing that hurts the film enormously , though , is that freakin ' little brat who plays Dvorak's son . Kids in classic movies are so often terrible , but this one takes the cake . Since a lot of the plot is about how hurt one parent is because the child is with the other , it doesn't always work . You want to shove that kid's face in a blender .
Heavy-handed , but not ineffective	Certainly the preachiest film ever to win Best Picture , and almost the preachiest film ever to be made , but that doesn't necessarily mean that Gentleman's Agreement isn't a good movie . In fact , I thought it was a fine film and an important one . It's heavy-handedness is mostly evened out by a lot of good dialogue , good filmmaking , and exceptional performances . I'll start there . I thought every principal actor succeeded with flying colors ; even when they have to deliver awful and obvious message speeches , they almost always ended up making that writing sound a lot better than it was . Gregory Peck gives one of his very best performances . I'm glad to see him give this performance , too , after being stupefied by that wooden performance in the same year's The Paradine Case . The script does well with the character of Phil Green . When he begins his quest to discover the anti-semitism around him , he is involved very impersonally . It's a job , a job he doesn't really want to do , a job he doesn't even know how to do . And when he gets his big idea , to pretend he's Jewish himself , it seems almost arrogant . How dare he , I thought . But , through the film , he does get personally involved , so deeply involved that the insults and jokes and so forth become personal attacks . I doubt he ever expected that it would hurt so much . In comparison to the other film about anti-Semitism in 1947 , Crossfire , also nominated for Best Picture , Gentleman's Agreement certainly does not hold up in terms of filmmaking and artistry . However , which film do you think had more of a chance to make a difference ? Where Gentleman's Agreement succeeds , and Crossfire fails , is its ability to make the audience look inside themselves . Sure , it has to hit its audience with a sledgehammer before they look inside themselves to find their own prejudices and shortcomings , but I really think it works .
One of the best of W . C . Fields ' short films	Personally , I like Fields ' features much more than the few short films he made . The Bank Dick , You Can't Cheat an Honest Man , You're Telling Me , The Old-Fashioned Way , It's a Gift , Never Give a Sucker an Even Break , and The Man on the Flying Trapeze are some of the funniest films you're ever likely to see . But most of his shorts are somewhat lame . My favorite is The Golf Specialist , which is nothing more - nor should it be - than Fields ' infamous vaudeville routine . The Dentist is famous for its sexual innuendo of the woman wrapping her legs around Fields while he pulls a tooth , but it's not very funny after that . The Barber Shop is the second funniest of these shorts . Fields is very funny in it , and so are the supporting cast members . Here Fields is in henpecked husband mode , taking it from his evil vegetarian wife . His little son likes to tell him the lamest riddles in history . The slight plot is a prelude to The Bank Dick , with a criminal on the run and Fields bragging that he'd throttle him good if he got a hold of him . A lot of good jokes here . See it on the Criterion disc of his short films . .
AS YOU WISH , MASTER	Bela Lugosi plays an evil plantation owner in Haiti who knows how to utilize black magic , like voodoo dolls and zombies . Madge Bellamy plays the woman whom Lugosi turns into a zombie , and is quite stunning in her white wedding dress and her enormous eyes ; she could have been ( possibly was ? ) a great silent movie starlette . Basically , White Zombie is a beautiful horror film that moves too slowly at times and kind of lame by the end , but the majority of it is very interesting . The direction and acting are above average , as well as the cinematography - possibly the best of any classic horror film I've seen . See it if you get a chance . .
Let me be the hundredth to praise Roy Harryhausen	Generally Jason and the Argonauts is only passable as entertainment . The story is weak , as are the characters and the acting . I don't think many would argue that 99 % of the film's worth is to be found in Roy Harryhausen's effects ( the other 1 % probably coming from Bernard Herrmann's rousing score ) , which earn the adjective " special " a thousandfold . Talos , the Harpies , the Hydra and the skeletons , these are the four sequences that we wait for and hold our breath during . They have barely aged - partly because the CGI effects that we've spent so long inventing don't look anywhere near as good as the reliable art of Harryhausen . He himself perhaps surpassed himself , at least animation-wise , with his Medusa in Clash of the Titans , but the skeleton battle is arguably the most exciting special effects sequence I can think of . The choreography of that fight is impeccable , with the actors actually acting like they're fighting , instead of just swinging their swords at where special effects would appear in post-production ( some of the other stop-motion sequences in the film contain wild weapons flailing , most notably the Harpies sequence ; no big criticism , though ; it still looks amazing ) . As it stands , it really is a whole lot of fun and a quality picture . .
Baffling in its very existence , this film has a place in film history	Ever wonder what European soft-core porn would look like in 1931 ? If you do , you are weird . But , if you do wonder what it'd be like , check out Maedchen in Uniform . To be fair , it is a bit more artistic than Emanuelle , but there is little subtlety to the lesbian erotica happening in this film . It turns out better than it started . I actually felt the characters ' troubles to be honest and touching by the end . I cared what happened . I also believe that this film must have been somewhat well known to European filmmakers at the time . The direction is excellent , and it reminds me a bit of such directors as Jean Vigo and Jean Renoir among others .
I wouldn't call this a great movie , but it's definitely a must-see . It's finally on DVD in Region 1 !	Saw this several years ago on a VHS bootlegged from the Japanese , blurred-pubes laser disc . It's probably because of the lousy format that I hardly remember a thing about it . Finally , after years of waiting , it gets released in Region 1 in a super-deluxe box set from Anchor Bay , which also includes The Holy Mountain , Fando y Lis , an early short ( La Cravate ) , full-length commentaries , a feature documentary about director Alejandro Jodorowsky , and the soundtracks to both El Topo and The Holy Mountain . Talk about an awesome package ! And for only $30 on Deep Discount DVD . This may just be the DVD of the year . As for the film itself , while I may not remember it very well , I remember my reaction to it , and my opinion is mostly unchanged . It's a product of its acid-laced time , and the film itself is mostly just silly and pretty much the definition of weird for the sake of weird . That's not to say I dislike it , however . Oh no , I can appreciate weird for the sake of weird , and this is a very entertaining movie in that respect . It also has some of the most amazing and imaginative images ever committed to film . My favorite sequence is probably the rabbit corral .
Somewhat disappointing considering the skill involved , but still good	Pretty good movie about a man and his wife who get caught up in murder and the police officer investigating the case . It starts off marvelously , but kind of hits a wall at a certain point . We're sure we know what happened , then a tiny plot thread that seems at first like a red herring pops back up and disappoints . Still , Clouzot's direction is great , and the acting is quite good . Louis Jouvet , who also co-starred in Marcel Carné's Drôle de Drame , gives the best performance as the clever detective . I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this film when they wrote Fargo . Much like that film , the police officer doesn't appear until nearly halfway through , and then he becomes almost the focus of the film . There's also a lot of droll comedy surrounding him ( although sometimes his methods seem sort of fascist ) .
Good , but imdb voters are overrating it	The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his ' most personal work , ' as the back of the DVD case says . In fact , it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him ; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well . As a director , it is a small achievement . Likewise , the screenplay writes itself ; in fact , it did write itself , as it's based on a true story . I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe . Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers . Or , more specifically , executing a Jew . Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable , all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head . It's all too easy . Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences , which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it . Truth be told , The Pianist is a very good film . It's well done , and , while I don't think it's Polanski's best work , he does a good job . But it's too easy , I think , to overpraise something like this . It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars , but , after seeing the film , it doesn't surprise me . This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most , because it's easy . The three awards it won were not deserved , at least in my opinion . If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes , it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese , who made an original picture with verve and passion , and that Brody ( I haven't mentioned him , and he is good ) beat Daniel Day-Lewis , who , as I've just said above , creates a character that will live forever . As for the screenplay , Ronald Harwood ( and / or Polanski ) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival . There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found . I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room , yearning to be able to do something about it , but always relegated to the spectator's role . They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman , but they don't do very much . Of course , I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance . In fact , it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was . Of course , that might have been disrespectful . I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year , and I would rank them as follows : 1 ) The Hours ; 2 ) Gangs of New York ; 3 ) The Pianist ; 4 ) Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers ; 5 ) Chicago . That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows , because , to tell you the truth , I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher . The first two were original , intelligent , and challenging . The last three were much simpler , and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved . .
Certainly not on the level of 2001 , but it complements Kubrick's film well	I usually refer to 2001 : A Space Odyssey as my favorite film of all time . I always balked at this sequel , which I attempted to watch many years ago but gave up quickly . Finally watching it all the way through , I don't know what exactly I was objecting to so strenuously . I was afraid , I think , that this film would take away the mystery of the Kubrick film . It is true that 2010 is a much more straightforward film , but I'm happy to say it's far from stupid . It's actually quite intelligent science fiction . This film emphasizes a major but often overlooked theme of the first film , the Cold War . In 2010 , Dr . Heywood Floyd , here played by Roy Scheider , along with two other American scientists ( Bob Balaban and John Lithgow ) accompany a ship of Russian cosmonauts ( among them Helen Mirren ) to the moons of Jupiter on an expedition to recover the Discovery . The movie lacks 2001's sense of awe , but it has its own sense of dread that I quite liked . And while the climax and end are somewhat confusing , it kind of captures the mystery of the original film . This is hardly the insult to 2001 : A Space Odyssey I always expected , and in fact I think it compliments it quite well .
Third best version ( though I haven't seen the new one yet ) , but still undervalued	The third version of Jack Finney's novel is actually quite good , too . It sets the action in a military base , where a man from the EPA and his family have just arrived to do some tests . The protagonist of the film is the man's teenage daughter ( played by the luminous Gabrielle Anwar ) . There's little set-up in this version . When it begins , the pods have already started to spread . This speeds up the proceedings . I might even complain that things happen too fast . The film is more action oriented ? which is especially proved in its hilarious final sequence . Let's just say that , unlike the other versions , which take place in urban areas , they have lots of big weapons at a military base . Despite this , the film is quite effective as horror . A lot of scenes are recycled , always intelligently , from the previous two films ( love the take on the " I didn't tell you my name ! " scene from the ' 78 version , as well as " You can fool them . " ) . They also come up with some really good new ones , like the day care sequence , where the 6 year-old son of the EPA investigator figures out that something's going on . The direction in general is gorgeous . Some of the performances are a bit weak . I especially didn't care for Billy Wirth , the hero , who may be incredibly handsome , but he's handsome in a way that says : " I am a New Kids on the Block reject ! " Recognizable faces include Forest Whitaker and R . Lee Ermey ( who tends to pop up whenever a film needs authentic military-type persons ) , as well as Meg Tilly , who has the film's most memorable line . Undervalued .
Wanna give your kiddies nightmares for the rest of their lives ?	About five years ago , when I had just graduated from high school , a friend of mine who had been to college introduced me to the works of Jan Svankmajer . He had checked out a VHS copy of three short films , Darkness / Light / Darkness , Male Games , and The Death of Stalinism in Bohemia . All three of them were works of great genius , and I immediately stored Svankmajer's name in my vault . So it's sad that it took me all five of these years to see another one of his works . I had thought about buying his Faust back when DVDs were dirt-cheap ( do you remember those happy days ? ) , but had passed over it for something else . Now I finally found another one of his films , Alice , this one a feature , his adaptation of Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventures of Wonderland . And , wow , this is one frightening little film , a mix of live-action ( well , one little girl ) and stop-motion animation of characters like the White Rabbit , the Mad Hatter , and the Queen of Hearts . Stop-motion animation has always looked creepy , and Sankmajer knows it . He also knows that dead animals are scary , and he incorporates their bones into his animation . It makes the whole film more visceral and surreal . There are two parts of this film that deserve particular attention . 1 ) the soundtrack . There is no musical score , and the only music at all is the tiny piece that plays over the closing credits . No , by soundtrack I am referring to the sound effects , and they are absolutely amazing . 2 ) the setting . The original novel and the Disney film set the story in a bizarre forest . Sankmajer sets the story in a delapidated house , with rotting and filthy wooden beams everywhere , creaky doors , and old cabinets . The setting is what makes the film particularly creepy . As for standout scenes , the caterpillar is pretty awesome . The very best scene , though , is definitely the tea party , with the Mad Hatter and March Hare . Svankmajer's conception of those two characters and of the tea party is truly inspired , and ranks among the best scenes in cinema , in my opinion . So is it perfect ? No . The idea to have Alice speak all the lines , and then show her lips speaking such words as : " The Mad Hatter said " every two minutes grows annoying quickly , and the film would perhaps have been a masterpiece had this flaw been avoided . It seems to be in there for adding time , and it's truly unfortunate . I also wish that Svankmajer would have hurried up the beginning of the film , so as to get to other great scenes in the novel . It takes a half hour before Alice gets into Wonderland , and that's the only time the film grows boring . Whatever . This is still a great film . .
An unknown gem by Fassbinder , one of his best works	Really , the plot is nothing different than your average movie on the Lifetime cable network : a woman suffers from [ I ] post-partem [ / I ] depression while no one around her seems to care much ; eventually , she becomes addicted to Valium and alcohol . But what a difference a genius can make , and Fassbinder is clearly a genius . And his lead actress , Margit Carstensen , gives an absolutely brilliant performance . It's a small and subtle picture ( made for television , actually ) , and I wonder if anyone else would be as impressed as I was . But I really felt that Fassbinder and Carstensen captured something remarkable here . The other actors are fine , as well . Ulrich Faulhaber plays her odd husband . He cares for his wife , but probably not in the way she needs . I noticed early in the film that he never touches his wife , and later in the film his mother complains that it is abnormal the way the mother hugs and kisses her children . The nosy mother-in-law is played by Brigitte Mira , looking really ugly after making me cry in Fear Eats the Soul , made the previous year . I would say that that character is a cliché if I didn't know so many people exactly like her ! Irm Herrmann plays the sister-in-law , and Adrian Hoven plays a pharmacist with whom Carstensen begins an affair after her prescription for Valium runs out . These two characters have the kind of hidden depth that make the film so good . The same can be said about Kurt Raab and Ingrid Caven , both playing other people with psychological problems , the former appearing once in a while in the streets and staring knowingly at Carstensen , the latter Carstensen's roommate at an asylum in which she undergoes some treatment ; when Carstensen is undergoing sleep therapy , Caven desperately wants to converse with her , but when she is awake the woman becomes catatonic . Peer Raben's music is excellent , as always , and Fassbinder uses the music of Leonard Cohen wonderfully ( as he also did in his more famous 1975 film , Fox and His Friends ) . .
I loved this movie !	I rented this movie because I loved Toni Collette in The Sixth Sense and expected it to be a pretty good Australian flick , but it was much , much better than I had ever expected . One thing I have to complain about , though , has nothing to do with the actual movie : I have to make a complaint about the box . Miramax made this film look like a goofy Aussie romantic comedy . Every critical comment on the box lauded its humor . I even think they made Collette look skinnier on the cover . These people are utter thugs ! This is a drama with some funny moments . I cried more than I laughed . There are so many beautifully drawn characters here . I never wanted this film to end . And it was wonderfully written . I have only some small complaints about the actual film . This is why I didn't give it a 10 : the annoying friend characters who pretend to like Muriel and Rhonda when it's convenient are used way too often . They should not have been brought back near the end . The third act is also kind of long . There are three separate conflicts that have to be solved , and it just takes a bit too long .
Marvelous	Visconti's first feature , Ossessione is an adaptation of James M . Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice . Now , I'm not familiar with that book or the other film versions , but I am a big fan of Cain's Double Indemnity ( much more so than I am a fan of Billy Wilder's film version of it , in fact ) . The two novellas seem like they must be very similar . Both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her . Giovanna , the woman in this Italian version , played very well by Clara Calamai , is not evil incarnate like the wife in Double Indemnity , but she seems very spoiled . Her husband ( a great performance by Juan de Landa ) is a bit cruel to her , but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him . He's older than her and unattractive , so she's rather fickle . When Gino shows up , a young , muscular man , it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed . She sweats she wants to be with him forever , but she's stuck with her husband . They break up at first , but when they meet again , they ( apparently , although this is intentionally vague ) plan to murder the husband . They are successful , and they move back to the woman's home town to run the bar that her husband owned . Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea . He wants Giovanna , but the one thing that he certainly doesn't want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life . Their relationship quickly crumbles . Ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters . It's always fascinating , but it does go on a bit too long . At two hours and twenty-two minutes , I can't , for the life of me , figure out how it took that long ! This is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that Visconti was inventing within this film . It was , after all , the first film that won that label . We see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life , without any hurrying to the next plot point . I've seen many of Visconti's films , and the only one I like better than this one is Rocco and His Brothers ( 1960 ) . His direction is as great as it ever was , with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect . I also feel the need to point out the film's best performance , by Dhia Christiani as a young ( exotic ) dancer and part-time prostitute named Anita whom Gino meets after he begins to try to break away from Giovanna . She's only in the film for maybe five or six minutes , and she has only a few lines . It's shocking how much Visconti and Christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time . She's absolutely heartbreaking . .
Don't know about Coward , but I know my Lubitsch and this is a fine one	Lubitsch's adaptation of the Noel Coward play about a ménage à trois starring Gary Cooper , Fredric March and Miriam Hopkins . The two men play a painter and a poet , and Hopkins the girl who moves in with them as their muse and critic . Edward Everett Horton plays the more down-to-Earth man who also vies for Hopkin's attention . Apparently , only the plot of Coward's play is kept here , with all of the dialogue excised because it was too dirty for 1930s Hollywood . Even with that , the film was censored on release and , after 1934 , when the Hayes Code was in stronger effect , it wasn't allowed to be shown at all . As it is , it's quite a fantastic movie , as you might expect from Lubitsch . It's funny and charming , but it's also quite a bit darker and more serious than the American films he had made before it in the sound era . I'd really like to read and / or see the original Coward play , but Lubitsch's version is undoubtedly a very good film .
Sounds kind of like a blaxploitation flick , doesn't it ?	Actually , it's a British period piece that has many plot elements in common with a strain of movies of the 1940s , like Rebecca , Dragonwyck , and even Duel in the Sun . A woman working as a maid , Blanche Fuller ( Valerie Hobson ) , discovers that she is on the fringes of a very wealthy family , the Furies . When she arrives , she discovers a strange situation . Her family , the Fullers , who come from a lower class background , have married into the Furies , all of whom have died . The only remaining Fury , or possibly a Fury , is Philip Thorn ( Stewart Granger ) , supposedly the illegitimate son of the last living Fury . He works on their estate , called Claire , but he is trying to inherit the estate ; his lawyer is researching his lineage . He's desperate to get his hands on the place . When Blanche marries her cousin , Laurence Fury , Thorn devises to seduce her . Also in his plotting he decides to use a group of Gypsies who have come into conflict with Claire and the Furies . Though it took a while for Blanche Fury to capture my wandering attention , eventually I started to get into it . The performances are what drew me in . Granger was especially delightful as the evil , scheming Thorn . I had to laugh at his clever deviousness at times . A man after my own heart , he is ! Hobson is quite good , as is Michael Gough , who plays her weakling husband . The color cinematography and musical score are fine . The script feels like it came from a novel , but it was written for the screen , making it especially impressive . I like the character arc of Blanche Fury . She begins as a sort of a schemer herself , planning to get rich and wield her feminine power over the estate . Only when she comes into conflict with Thorn , a more clever and desperate conspirator , does she realize she herself has done wrong and will now have to do the right thing . The ending is weird , but rather haunting . This is an exceptional film . .
The screenplay is a little screwy . . .	And I don't mean that the movie is weird . I like that . Everyone should appreciate the freshness of this movie . What I mean is that the screenplay is a little uneven . When I first saw this film ( on opening day , luckily ) , I liked it a lot but felt that there was a major problem . It took me months to figure out why I felt this way , but I did finally figure it out , and I have confirmed it on subsequent viewings . The first half hour or so , all the screen time before the portal is found , contains an entirely different humor than the rest of the picture . And this humor is mostly childish and unfunny . The secretary and the joke about her being an expert on speaking disabilities was very unfunny . I feel embarrassed when I watch it it's so bad . The video about why the 7 floor exists is also extremely unfunny , as well as the 7 floor itself . I didn't find any of these things funny , and there were even more than that . I did like the puppet show that Craig gave on the street corner , I did like Dr . Lester's sexual rantings ( although dirty old men jokes are really commonplace ) , and I laughed a lot when Craig was guessing Maxine's name . Fortunately , when the portal is found , the childish humor pretty much completely vanishes . The rest of this movie is very intelligent . Every joke hits . There are no misses like there are in the first half hour . But what is really special about this film is how smoothly it becomes a compelling drama and character study . It is so well filmed . Watch how the Craig , Lottie , and Maxine dolls are used all through the film . I really felt it when Maxine was covering up the Lottie puppet . I actually teared up during the chase through Malkovich's subconscious , which I think is probably the single best scene that appeared in a film in 1999 . And I also wept at the very , very , very beautiful ending . The second time I saw this in a theater , they cut out the beginning of the credit sequence where Emily was swimming , and I absolutely screamed , telling everyone in the theater about the sham that had been pulled . And I found the ending even more startling on the third viewing because I hadn't realized what actually happened to Craig at the end on my first and second viewings . I love this movie , so I am very hurt by the childish humor in the first half hour . It does embarrass me . It detracts from the whole film . Overall , I have to give it a .
A wonderful , sentimental , and bittersweet film	If you're wondering which Spike Lee film to watch first , if you're a little worried that you won't like his work , Crooklyn is a good one to start with . I certainly don't want to express disdain for his more polemic works , which represent some of the best work the cinema has to offer , but it might intimidate some people . Crooklyn , written by Lee , his sister , and his brother , seems to be a representation of their childhood in Brooklyn , mostly told from the sister's point of view , named Troy in this film . It's mostly a great film about childhood , among the best ever made . It's a marvelous experience . However , Lee trips a lot in the scenes which take place when Troy is living with her aunt in the South . First off , the scenes are filmed with a wider aspect ratio than the rest of the film and then are pulled to fit the original aspect ratio . The result is that everything is pulled out of proportion . I'm assuming that Lee did this to represent a distorion , a world out of whack or something of the sort . Well , it doesn't work . Every minute of those scenes are annoying for that reason . To boot , the characters in the South are underdeveloped , as well as the situation in general , and everything is treated like with smarmy humor , the religious aunt and the little dog and so forth . Luckily those scenes are short . It feels almost as if Lee aborted this section of the film . The rest of the film is simply wonderful . .
This should be better known	A remarkable film that , had it been made in Italy around the same time , would today be called an important and seminal film . It's worth mentioning right next to any of Antonioni's films , which it sort of resembles . There are only two Greek directors who are well known outside of their country , and I was hoping that this film was made by someone else , but alas , it's the lesser of the two , Cacoyannis . Well , at least now I have a different perspective of his work . I know him from Zorba the Greek , of course , but also fragments of a few of his Greek tragedy adaptations , most notably Iphigeneia , of which I've seen the vast majority of . Zorba is an excellent film , although far from perfect , and Iphigeneia was very , very weak . A Matter of Dignity is easily the best of the three ; I would call it a near-masterpiece . ' Near ' because there are too many flaws to ignore . And , though the flaws are interesting , for the most part , they are too nagging . But still , this is an exceptional film . The daughter of an affluent family , Chloe ( Ellie Lambeti ) , discovers that her family's affluence is pretty much a put-on . They are going broke , and going fast . They have pushed themselves into the bourgeosie of Athens , which has run them out of money . But it's difficult to give up such a lifestyle . Chloe is currently being courted by a rather boring millionaire , but when she finds out her family's secret , she decides to give in to his advances . Meanwhile , another man , poorer and more attractive , begins to court her , too . This is the film's biggest flaw , the love triangle . It's cliché , for sure , but the worst thing about it is the second man , who is supposed to be the audience's favorite , you'd figure , seems more of a playboy seducer than the millionaire . This guy's kind of a jerk , it seemed like to me . Besides , he is barely in the film . On the other hand , the millionaire seems like a nice guy , kind of pudgy and naïve . At one point he desperately wants to show Chloe his Fabergé collection , which he eventually does , ever so coyly offering them to her . Luckily , the script doesn't follow the path I was sure it would . That's kind of a gift in itself , but I still think it would have been better to drop that second possible lover completely . The moral situations of the film are too complex for such a clichéd element . The other major narrative thread of the film , the most interesting , is that of the family's maid , Katerina . She hasn't been paid for a while , but she trusts that her family will come through . At one point , though , her own child gets into an accident , and when she needs Chloe and her parents to help her , they entirely forget her because of their own selfish lives . When she does finally get back to Athens , she confronts them . The juxtaposition between the problems of the classes are ingenious here . But I also like the way Cacoyannis allows us into the point of view of the bourgeosie ( mostly Chloe ) without judgind too harshly . Some might not like the way we are supposed to sympathize with Chloe when she must endure the hardships of a bus ride with people of the lower classes , but , then again , those who may disapprove of the way this scene is done probably have never travelled on a Greyhound bus . Just kidding . This fear and disgust that Chloe initially feels is resolved later on ; that scene has tremendous payoff , anyhow . As for the elements that make up the film , they are all excellent . As I said , this far outranks Zorba ; Cacoyannis directs wonderfully . The most praiseworthy element , however , is Ellie Lambeti's lead performance . She is truly a revelation , and , had this film been more widely seen upon its release , I would guess that we would know her name as well as we know Monica Vitti's , Anna Karina's , Liv Ullmann's , and all the other great foreign actresses . IMDb commenter David Stafford comes up with one of the most perfect descriptions , and I certainly couldn't beat it : ' She's Audrey Hepburn's tragic Greek shadow . ' The other great performance in the film comes from the actress who play's Chloe's mother , Athena Michaelidou . .
A true gem , all the way	Just like when Jed Clampett was out shootin ' for some food , I thought that I'd watch this movie because I was hungry to see every single version of William Faulkner's fiction put to film . I expected possum stew , but , lo and behold , this was quite the bubblin ' crude . I mean , who would expect such a high quality movie to be made for television , a Hallmark Hall of Fame production , at that ? Well , the script was written by Horton Foote , most famous , I imagine , for his script for To Kill a Mockingbird . The original story is half of Faulkner's masterpiece If I Forget Thee , Jerusalem , which brilliantly alternates between the stories Old Man and The Wild Palms ( a name by which the novel has also been known ) . The Wild Palms is the better half of the novel , I think most people would agree . It's a tragedy about a woman who leaves her husband for a young man studying to become a doctor . The resulting scandal forces them to wander around the country , and the story ends with the gravest tragedy . Old Man , on the other hand , is a comedy . Where The Wild Palms presents a sickly and pained relationship , Old Man presents a parody of a marriage . A convict ( Arliss Howard ) is enlisted to help save people who are caught in the flood of 1927 , perhaps the largest the United States has ever seen ( it completely covered most of the South for miles on both sides of the Mississippi , and probably most other rivers , as well ) . He is specifically sent to rescue a young woman in a tree and a man stuck on top of the roof of a cotton house . Well , although he doesn't know how to control the boat , he does find the woman ( Jeanne Tripplehorn ) . He never finds the man on the cotton house roof , but he does find the woman in the tree , and she's eight and a half months pregnant . They get lost on the giant lake which was the South . Though the opportunity for escape , for a whole new life presents itself almost constantly , Howard refuses to take it . He's stubborn ; he only has nine more years to serve ( for a silly , attempted train robbery that barely got off the ground ) , and , dammit , he's gonna serve them no matter what . The movie consists of little more than muted conversations between the chattering woman and the convict of few words . A kind of love arises between them . This doesn't happen the same way in the original story . In fact , my sense was that the convict , who had been in jail since the tender age of 19 , had had no experience with women whatsoever and was downright afraid of both the woman and her baby , who is born in the first couple of days afloat . The comedy of this half of the novel is lessened and the work is made more dramatic . Without the tragedy of The Wild Palms , this actually works very well . The two lead performances are great . I would never expected this amount of depth from Tripplehorn , whose career has been middling at best . This proves her to be a viable actress . Arliss Howard , though I've seen him in a hundred movies , several of which are personal favorites , I do not recognize whatsoever . His performance in this film is nothing short of masterful , just magnificent .
Would-be masterpiece slightly knocked down by a weak ending	A beautiful melodrama , which , at its best , nears Sunrise . Janet Gaynor starred in both of them , and one the first Best Actress Oscar for her work in those two films . She plays a destitute Parisian girl kicked out of her home by her father . When a police officer attempts to arrest her , a sewer worker who has just been promoted to a street cleaner ( Charles Farrell ) selflessly claims that she is his wife . The two have to uphold this charade for a few days , but , by the end , they are in love . By the time they realize this and get married , though , WWI has begun and the men are off to war . The first half , maybe more , is the romantic part , and it is wonderful . Some of the best filmmaking around , and a couple of scenes that are just gorgeous . I will never forget sweet Janet Gaynor putting Farrell's coat on the back of a chair and then , sitting in that chair , she puts the coat's arms around her body . The second half , the war half , is very good , but it pulls down the magical romance into reality . Which isn't necessarily a bad thing , I suppose , no matter how much I was enjoying that first half . It's a good war film , at least the equal of Wings . The battle sequences are well produced and harrowing . Meanwhile , Gaynor faces the no-longer harmless flirtations of a Colonel . The direction is always fantastic . The visual and narrative motif of altitude is very well done , with Farrell beginning in the sewers and , a bit later , he ascends to the stars in his tall apartment building . Seventh Heaven might have been a masterpiece , but it completely crumbles by the end . The end should have written itself . The end of the war should have been the sign that Farrell had not abandoned Gaynor . Unfortunately , we have to deal with an entirely tacked-on ending . It can't ruin the film , of course . .
The green monster rears its ugly head	SLIGHT SPOILERSEl is similar in style to other productions made by Bunuel in Mexico . It reminded me of both Los Olvidados and Nazarin . Unlike in the early or late films , the style is more realistic and more akin to melodrama . In fact , all three of these films each contain a single surrealist scene . Los Olvidados has the dream , Nazarin has the fantasy where the wife bites off her husband's lower lip , and El has , well , El's surrealist moment comes near the end and is too good to give away . If you've seen the film , I'm sure you know to what I refer . El can be divided up into three easily identifiable sections , each about a half-hour each . The first is told from the point of view of an aristocrat who catches sight of a beautiful woman in church . It's love at first sight , but he soon finds out that she is the wife of a friend of his . At this point , I was fully expecting a cheapy adulterous romance picture , a soap opera . That was the genre that was dominating Mexican cinemas at the time . Luckily , the film doesn't follow a predictable route . There is at this point an elipsis of time , as that first man runs into the woman . He innocently offers her a ride home . Grudgingly , she accepts . On the ride home , she tells him of how her husband's jealously is destroying her . He's an extremely paranoid man , and he has actually threatened to murder her on two separate occasions . She finds opposition everywhere as she is looking for help . The third section of the film is told from the point of view of the husband . His jealousy is starting to lead him off a cliff . The title of the film actually refers to him . " El " is the masculine , singular , definite article in Spanish . Bunuel had a gift for endings . El's is as good as that of Nazarin or Viridiana . By the way , a bit of trivia about that final image : the actor in the cloak at the end of the film , walking down the path , is not the same one who played Francisco in the rest of the film . It's Bunuel . .
Forceful and powerful	Startling , forceful tale of women descending into a life of prostitution in post-war Osaka . Kinuyo Tanaka , who would play the lost mother of the protagonists in Sansho the Bailiff , stars as a woman who lost both her husband and son to illness long after the war has ended . When her younger sister , Sanae Takasugi , steals the man she's having an affair with , she joins the streetwalkers . Mizoguchi was heavily influenced by Italian Neorealism here , and most of it was filmed in the ruined streets of Osaka . It's blunt as Hell , and arguably exploitative . Mizoguchi disowned it later in his career . The two best sequences in the film , one where a group of prostitutes denudes a young rape victim , and the final one where Tanaka comes to the rescue of the same girl when another group of prostitutes is attacking her , are the seeds that would spawn Seijun Suzuki's Gate of Flesh . That's definitely a compliment , in my book . That final sequence in particular , despite more than a little heavy-handedness ( it takes place in a burnt-out church ) , is one of the most emotionally draining in the director's career .
Great Film , but I think Kurosawa did better	Watching this film for over 3 hours , I felt excited every step of the way . I thought the situation was interesting , the characters were interesting , the acting was spectacular , and the action to be very intelligently crafted . But I felt there were some small problems , as well . The characters ' names were rarely spoken , so it became easier to mix some of the characters up as the film progressed . Especially , I thought two of the samurai looked very like each other ( and the person with whom I was watching this film had the same problem , so it's not just me ) . Also , I don't think this film belongs within the top ten of anyone's list . It is very well directed and executed , but it has no profundity . After I was done watching it , I put it away , went to my room , and thought very little about it . A great film leads to pondering . I think Kurosawa's _ Rashomon _ and , even moreso , _ Ran _ contained a lot more depth . Also , Japan has produced many , many very thoughtful and powerful animated films such as _ Princess Mononoke _ and _ Grave of the Fireflies _ . _ The Seven Samurai _ is a great film , but I would hesitate to call it a masterpiece .
Wildly inspirational	Salt of the Earth is simply one of the greatest achievements in American cinema , not because it is exemplary in those aspects which usually make a film great , but because it excels in its ideals where so many others during the period were failing . The plot is deceptively simple . Mexican American men , along with a few whites ( " Anglos " in the Mexicans ' parlance ) , decide that their job in the mine is too dangerous and that they are treated unfairly compared to Anglo workers . They strike , putting their families through terrible hardships . While this film certainly has an agenda , it thankfully becomes more complex than just a Labor vs Management dispute . Perhaps an even more important theme is the relationship between the men and their women , wives , mothers , sisters . At one point , the Taft-Hartley Act is enacted ( of course I mention the name because of recent events ) , and the miners can no longer picket legally . Their wives , who are asked , according to the local mores , to be silent , dare to pick up the duties of the strike . Not only is Salt of the Earth a brave champion of the worker and minorities , it has the audacity ( in 1954 ! ) to back women's rights . No wonder this was the only American film to be blacklisted .
Jazz up your lingerie !	Among some movie buffs , there is a line of thought about Gene Kelly that he comes off as an unlikeable and smug jerk . Those people have never seen a film starring Maurice Chevalier . Kelly might stalk you until you fall for him , and a little more creepily than Fred Astaire would , but at least you know he'd probably stick around afterward . Chevalier , not so much . Behind that gigantic smile lies a snake . His thick French accent may have been sexy back in the day , but hearing it now just ups his jerk percentage higher and higher . Honestly , though , I love the guy . He's such a goofy character . He may be a cad , but he's an entertaining one . I shake my head at how naughty he is , but always with a grin on my lips . Chevalier is at his most delightfully awful in The Smiling Lieutenant , playing a philandering Viennese officer currently courting violinist Claudette Colbert . During a ceremony honoring royalty visiting from postage stamp-sized Flausenthurm , Chevalier smiles , laughs and winks at Colbert . The princess of Flausenthurm ( Miriam Hopkins ) catches it , thinks its for her , and demands that something be done about it . Queue the shotgun wedding , and Maurice is in hot water , now wedded to a wet blanket and in love with a hot tomato . The movie is pretty raunchy by 1931 standards . Unsurprisingly , the film was considered lost for many years . I'm sure the Hayes Code enforcers would have been quite happy with burning every print . There's a ton of sex being had by the characters , and there's a whole song dedicated to women's underwear . Seriously . Claudette Colbert teaches Miriam Hopkins about modern fashions in " Jazz Up Your Lingerie " , easily the best number in the film and , in my mind , one of the weirdest and most entertaining in cinema history . I'd have to do some extensive looking into all the musicals I've ever seen , but I'd estimate that this is top five material . Hopkins completely steals the movie . The liner notes in the Eclipse Lubitsch Musicals set claims that it is her first film , but IMDb lists at least one earlier feature . The plot is very silly ; one wouldn't imagine that it could contain any real emotion . But I actually did feel for Hopkins after Chevalier refused to sleep with her on their wedding night . This is where you can't help but hate Maurice . I also liked George Barbier , who plays Hopkins ' father . And one of my favorite character actors , Charles Ruggles , appears very briefly at the beginning .
Takashi Miike is my hero !	Miike makes another yakuza picture . It's not especially groundbreaking , and it's certainly not one of Miike's deeper films , but it is extremely entertaining . That's mostly because of the main character , Kunisada ( Miike regular Riki Takeuchi ) , who is the most psychopathic character in Japanese movies since Tatsuya Nakadai's evil samurai in Sword of Doom . Kunisada's mob boss , his surrogate father , is ambushed and murdered ( though not before nearly strangling his assailant to death ; the hit-man only lives because he cuts the dead man's hands off as they clench around his windpipe ) . Simultaneously , Kunisada , almost as if through a psychic bond , breaks out of jail and starts to go against the rival gang . The only problem is that the boss's death isn't necessarily a bad thing from his own gang's perspective . They and their rival gang try desperately to make a truce . Unfortunately for everyone , except for a small handful of loyal comrades , Kunisada won't stop until everyone around him is dead . The film suffers from Miike's major flaw as a filmmaker : a lack of coherency . There seem to be dozens of named characters , and it becomes very difficult to sort out who everyone is . I had to watch key scenes a second time to piece it all together ( though I had most of it straight by the end of the film ) . But , even if you never quite figure it out , Miike's patented break-neck action sequences are so outrageously done that the film is more than worth watching . Watch out when Kunisada finds a rocket launcher !
Provides more fun than all of the summer blockbusters put together	The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies , and that they're all the rage , what with Lord of the Rings , Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office . This year will see ( and already has seen ) several more , most notably The Golden Compass , which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year . Stardust , based on a novel by Neil Gaiman , showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep . I saw no previews for it , only a couple of commercials . The critical reaction is kind of blah . I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum , and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend . Well , if you'll forgive the horrible pun , the stars must have been rightly aligned , because I went to see Stardust , and I loved it . It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings . The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest ( the hero sets out to look for a fallen star ) filled with obstacles . But within that basic outline , the story is lively and imaginative . It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun , and a charming little romance . And it succeeds wonderfully . There were a lot of big films this summer , but none of them were nearly as fun as this one . There's a lot going on , but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent . It isn't a masterpiece , but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has ( though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film ) . A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre .
I wrote this way back when I saw it in February of 2002	" A fantastic film about adolescence " Unfortunately , I doubt many in the U . S . will ever see it . I'm also unsure as to whether U . S . audiences would like it much anyway . I myself loved it - it's very beautiful , one of the best films on that age group I've ever seen . The story revolves around three teens in a Taipei high school , two girls and a boy . The girls like to think of themselves as BFFs ( " best friends forever ! " ) and , like any two best friends , they talk to each other about boys . The third character is the boy one of them likes . The two girls look for him one night and the girl who doesn't like him approaches him to tell him that her girlfriend has a crush on him . The second girl , however , is too nervous and flees the scene . The boy then thinks that the girl who approached him actually likes him but won't say it straight out . I won't go on with the plot . If I am wrong and it does get a U . S . release , I don't want to be the one who ruins the surprises ( I'll let the professional critics do that ) . Suffice it to say that , unlike American films about high school , Blue Gate Crossing remains simple and honest all the way through . There are no subplots or melodramatic developments . No one gets knocked up or dies in a tragic drag racing accident . We are just left to witness the sweet and beautiful events in the lives of these three characters . The reason that I believe it will never be officially released in the United States is this : it'll seem far too innocent . These kids are meant to be between 16 and 18 years old . For a U . S . audience , their actions and attitudes will seem like those of sixth graders . Perhaps even in Taiwan it will be seen as quaint . One of the film's producers , Peggy Chiao , was present at the screening I attended and she said that the director himself ( Yi Chih-yen ) was afraid that the film was too sweet . It's really up to 1 ) distributors and 2 ) film critics . Let's face it , the first obstacle for U . S . distribution will be nearly impossible to overcome . As for critics , people love to flaunt that critics in this modern day and age are meaningless . That may be true for the latest teen sex comedy , but for foreign films they are of the utmost importance . I am afraid that they will see little but an after school special in Blue Gate Crossing . Let's all hope I'm wrong and that this'll be the biggest foreign hit since Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . .
Great , but flawed ; Tom Hanks is wrong for the role	A great film with a painful amount of flaws . Technically , it's gorgeous . Conrad Hall's cinematography is original and stunning , and Thomas Newman's score is one of the more memorable of recent years ( and it's only rarely overused ) . Mendes keeps up his great technical direction . And the supporting actors are magnificent . Jude Law ( whose character design is awesome ; the make-up artists should be remembered , as well ) , Stanley Tucci , Dylan Baker ( possibly a tad too dandy ) , and Daniel Craig are all excellent . Law and Craig ought to be remembered around Oscar time . I would almost guarantee that Paul Newman will get nominated . He's excellent as an aging Irish crime boss , pulled between his screw-up real son ( played by Craig ) and his better , though adopted son , Michael Sullivan ( Tom Hanks ) . Newman has some great lines . The flaws lie in the script and in the central performances of the film . In the script , there are a couple of sidetracks that are unnecessary and should have been cut ( most notably the cliched sequence at the farmhouse with the nice farm people , and then the end should have been worked out better ) . In addition to this , the themes of the film are never explored to their full potential . Road to Perdition is about the relationships between father and son . We never really see enough between Newman and Hanks . Part of the fault exists in the script , but Tom Hanks and Tyler Hoechlin ( who plays Michael Sullivan Jr . ) are really not up to the job , and therefore the film falls far below what it should be . Hanks is in totally over his head here . We were all curious whether he could play a bad guy , and the answer comes pretty clearly : he can't ( btw , if you saw it and didn't notice this : Hanks never kills anyone on screen ; although there are a couple of ghastly deaths in the film , we never see Tom Hanks directly pull the trigger and kill someone ; he's always slightly off screen when he kills someone ) . I like the guy , but he seems so unsure of himself in this film . He's supposed to be a quiet tough guy , and that's not Tom Hanks . His sensitive side keeps popping out at bad times . Someone else should have played this role . Johnny Depp , perhaps ? Maybe even Bruce Willis . But not Tom Hanks . Little Hoechlin's failure probably can be blamed on Sam Mendes . He never seems sure what he's supposed to be feeling from scene to scene , and he changes moods abruptly and often unexpectedly . We ought to see the burgeoning relationship between him and his father . If that would have come out better , the film would have been 100 % more successful . But I've complained more than I should . All I'm saying is that Road to Perdition ended up being a disappointment because it promised so much . When it's good , it's fantastic . There are a couple of the best set pieces ever in this film . Just watch the scene where Hanks mows down a bunch of Newman's bodyguards in the rain ( Newman is particularly fantastic in this scene , and I love the way Mendes has him act here ) . There's also a brilliant montage of bank robberies where the camera is always drifting to the right . .
The European / DVD cut is just as good as the Grindhouse cut , if not better	I honestly don't get the hate here . Tarantino is a smug bastard , to be sure , but he makes fairly entertaining movies . People complain about the endless dialogue , but I quite enjoy it here . I like the bad , B-movie dialogue of the first half of the film , as well as the more Tarantino-esquire stuff of the second half . They're all interesting characters and fine actresses , and I certainly don't mind listening to them talk . And that last half hour is so much fun that I'd still have a positive view of it , even if I had been bored by most of the rest of it . I had also heard a lot of bad things about this longer cut , but I do not agree with them . I'm not sure I'd say the film gets better ? and definitely I wouldn't say it's a lot better . But I don't think it's worse , that's for sure . This version , after all , does contain the lap dance , which was infamously " missing " from the Grindhouse cut . And it's HOT ( and has a great song playing ) . There's also a stronger connection between the two halves . It still feels like two different films , but it makes more sense now . It's been reported that the conversation scenes are all extended . I don't think they are at all . Certainly not in the second half , the conversation in the restaurant . It's the same as it was in the Grindhouse cut . There are a couple of brief bits in the first half that are extended , but nothing over which to get angry . The second half contains a pretty good sequence where the new chicks are introduced . I don't see anything at all to object to , and I was glued to the screen for the entire film . I had thrown it in thinking I would fall asleep . The adrenaline that was pumping in my system would not allow for that .
Just a wrung below Raise the Red Lantern	In ten or twenty years , Zhang Yimou will be regarded as one of the greatest foreign directors . I think his film Raise the Red Lantern is one of the greatest films ever made , easily . Ju Dou is just one step below it . Its positive points are too numerous to mention in any great detail . Just let me warn you that , like almost every movie ever put on video , this film's video / DVD box lies horrendously about what you're about to experience . Ju Dou is not a passionate story of forbidden love . It is not Romeo and Juliette , and you're not going to desire to watch it every Valentine's Day . It is not erotic , but brutal . It is an utterly complex film which is consistently challenging . SPOILERS AHEADThe film starts off pretty conventionally with a mean old man purchasing a young wife in the hopes of producing a son with her . He spends several days beating her into submission . During this period , the old man's nephew , who is treated horribly by his uncle , begins to obsess over his new aunt's beauty . The aunt notices his obsession , and welcomes him as a sort of savior from the cruelty of her husband . We expect a plot where these two find a way to escape their common nemesis , or maybe even kill him . He seems like any other villain to us . The nephew and his aunt produce a child , which is passed off as the old man's . Soon after this , the old man is in an accident and is paralyzed below the waste . Now the young couple has their common tormentor at their mercy , and they use that to their full advantage with horrifying physical and mental torture . They almost instantly tell him that his son is actually the son of his nephew . They build him a tub with wheels ( the Chinese version of a wheelchair ) , and when he misbehaves , they suspend him from the ceiling . This behavior confuses us deeply . What would we do in a similar situation ? Maybe the same thing . But when we see it done , we cannot help but be horrified . Cruelty has begotten cruelty , and everything is spinning out of control . Meanwhile , the young child ages . He has not talked yet , and silently and painfully watches as his mother and cousin cavort , not hiding their lust in the least ( it does turn from passion to lust very quickly ) . The child does not feel that these two have any feelings for him , so he connects to the old man , whom he believes is his father . In fact , his first word comes when the old man is plotting to murder him : " Daddy , " spoken to the old man . The old man is ecstatic , not so much because his " son " has just spoken as because he knows the implications of the child knowing him as his father instead of his cousin . I won't go any further , but this film becomes more painful by the second . My complaints need to be voiced , too . They are few , but key . First , I think that the first half hour or so should have been fleshed out a bit . The relationships and even the characters could have stood to be more developed earlier on . I do not like how Yimou uses slow motion in this film . It does not feel right . My final complaint is with the very end of the film . It is a bit of a cop out , to end the story by burning the house down . I think the only problem in Raise the Red Lantern was also the very end , where Gong Li's character just goes insane . I think it is better to know that the character exists and will have to live with his / her mistakes forever . That is much more powerful , and a better ending . Anyhow , this film is a .
One of the most stunning pieces of filmmaking I've ever seen	Before the Revolution , Bernardo Bertolucci's second film , is kind of a mess . He was only 22 when he made it , and he must have made it immediately after he finished his first film , Grim Reaper . It's obvious that he's a genius from this film . Like I said , it's kind of a mess , but no more beautiful mess has ever been created in the cinema . The story is difficult to follow at times , but it is basically about a young bourgeois man who falls in love with his young aunt . Their relationship is socially unacceptable , so it immediately begins to break apart . As it does , politics rush into the film , confused politics , probably representing Bertolucci's own conflicting feelings at this point . The whole film feels very personal . I don't know . I really didn't catch too much of , well , what's going on . Which sounds bad , but there's a good reason for my missing everything : Bertolucci's direction is breathtaking . It is a nice cross between French New Wave and the Modernist movement that the Italian filmmakers were going through at the time . Bertolucci throws every single cinematic trick into the film that he can fathom . Everything works , though . It's showy , to be sure , but it's never less than one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced . It never seems less than amazing . The emotions of the film - and they really hit home , even if the story is difficult to follow - are fractured and manic . I need to watch Before the Revolution again . I feel , though , that even if I find it completely flawed the second time around , it could be nothing less than the greatest flawed masterpiece ever produced . 10 years after Before the Revolution , Bernardo Bertolucci directed what I consider my third favorite film , Last Tango in Paris . By then , he had perfected his style . I'll be adding another Bertolucci film to my list of favorites tonight .
How shocking that this turned out to be so great . Stanwyck is miraculous .	During the opening ten minutes of The Bitter Tea of General Yen or so , I was absolutely cracking up . I mean , it was the most preposterous , dated , and unintentionally funny film I thought I ever had seen . The film opens with a wedding ceremony where a priest tells a story of his missionary days in Mongolia : " I was telling the story of the crucifixion to a group of Mongolian bandits . I thought I was really getting to them . They kept moving closer and closer and they seemed so intent . A few days later , a group of travellers were captured in the desert by these bandits - they crucified them . I had misunderstood their reaction to my story . That , my friends , is the nature of Chinamen . " The camera swirls around to the face of an old Chinese man who looks vaguely threatening . The second scene concerns a woman , Megan Davis , ( Barbara Stanwyck , on her way to be married at the aforementioned wedding ) in a rickshaw , and a car runs the rickshaw driver down . As the car's owner steps out to examine the accident ( this is General Yen ) , Stanwyck shouts to him : " Hey , you ran over my rickshaw driver ! " General Yen replies something to the effect : " Who cares . He's just one person among millions . " Yes , it begins as a profoundly racist film , racism so ridiculous that it comes off as ultimately laughable . The next time we meet General Yen , he is teasing Megan's groom , a missionary on a mission to save some orphans , for preferring " ancestorless brats " to his sweet bride . I rolled my eyes in disbelief : the bad guy's so ruthless that he'd gladly let orphans perish , while the good guy , the missionary , is going to risk his life to save them . How Hollywood , I thought . A bit later , Megan is forced into Yen's sphere , where she witnesses further scenes of ridiculous cruelty and cold-heartedness , such as prisoners ' executions right outside her window at the crack of dawn ( " But I don't have the rice to feed these prisoners , " argues Yen . " Surely it is more humane to kill them quickly than let them starve . " Well , there is a certain logic to that . . . ) . A young Chinese girl , a slave of Yen's , Mao Lin , is taking care of her . There is another American present in Yen's court , Jones , a real scumbag , as it seems . SPOILERS : As the film proceeds , a lot of tension arises . Mao Lin is captured as being a spy , but Megan butts in before Yen can have her executed . In a scene of marvellous writing , she debates with Yen and preaches her Christian ethos . It turns out for naught , since Mao Lin tricks the naive woman and continues spying , eventually causing the downfall of Yen's power . We as the audience don't care that Yen has been toppled - although we are shown a human side to him , he's still a ripe bd - but Megan is devastated . No , not at Yen's downfall , either , but by the fact that everything that she had preached and stood by , what she told Yen would eventually cause him to come out the better , has actually destroyed him . She says very little after she has been doublecrossed . As Yen himself told her , what she preaches is just words that she learned in Sunday School . Through all this , there is an ambiguous romance arising between Megan and General Yen . Ambiguous because of the interracial aspect of it all , to be sure , but the ambiguities add much to the artistry of the film . Does General Yen actually fall in love with her , or is he just playing games with her ? At first , I would guess that it is all just a game - can Yen , a rich playboy , really win over a white woman , one who is set to marry a missionary whom he particularly hates and thinks is a fool ? There's also the aspect that he's trying to demonstrate how hypocritical missionaries - and white people - are . When he finally accepts Megan's terms on Mao Lin's life , he is absolutely sure that Mao Lin will betray her , and says as much to her face . And when Megan tells him that they are all of the same blood , he touches her hand , asking , " Do you mean that ? " No , of course not . She removes her hand from under his immediately . In the final scenes , though , he does seem to have some deep affection for her . There is a sense that , since he has proved her wrong , he believes that she should give herself up to him , and ultimately to die in suicide by his side . She does not go that far , but she does symbolically give herself to him in the climactic sequence , one of quiet beauty and nobility . Megan retreats to her room where she finds a makeup case and dress . These items refer to an earlier scene where , when she requests a dress and makeup , she makes herself up to look Chinese - she , too , is playing a sort of game , the kind which a tourist might play in an exotic location . But then she realizes that it may lead Yen on , so she takes off the makeup and wears a less Chinese dress . Now , at the end , she finds these items and makes herself up like a glamorous Chinese woman - a facsimile of Yen's wife , who , we're told , does not yet exist ( an empty seat next to his at the dinner table waits for the day ) . She does not marry him , nor does she die with him , but she holds his hand and rests her head on his lap while he dies . The final scene , at first , seemed to me somewhat superfluous : Jones , the crooked " money man , " is taking Megan back to Shanghai and her fiancee ( whom , I might add , she hadn't seen since they were children before she was taken by Yen ) . Jones drunkenly debates with himself whether or not she will marry her fiancee , and where they will all go after they die . When the film opened , the rigid world in which Megan was living would have provided easy answers to those questions . She doesn't say a single word during this scene , but we can tell by her face that those questions are no longer easily answered . .
Vastly undervalued Chaplin masterpiece	It's not only one of Chaplin's best films , but one of the most important films about America ever made . Thrown out of the US for his liberal views , Chaplin became very irate at America . This is his response , a bare-knuckle boxing match with Uncle Sam - and this tramp doesn't pull punches . He doesn't leave a stone unturned , movies , music , high culture , television , education , fame , and especially the communist witch hunts . Best of all , he still exhibits his comic brilliance , and almost all the jokes land . Chaplin's son Michael is very good as a young boy who espouses communist ideals without the slightest provocation . The film ends without resolution , as this dark period of American history was still going strong . Only the hope that it is only a phase is expressed , but otherwise , the darkness is left to brood . People have accused the film of not being subtle , but it is far more so than the infinitely more popular The Great Dictator , and also more so than his other two talkies , Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight . All of those films are great , but they all end up with Chaplin telling us directly what he wants us to walk away with . A King of New York is , even if it has its clunky moments , an exceptional achievement . It's about time that it was rediscovered . .
One of John Ford's best . Maybe THE best .	The Long Voyage home is not a typical film from this period . It differs in that it focuses on an ensemble cast instead of on a star . That's common nowadays , but not back then . Ford's Stagecoach , made the previous year , had quite an ensemble cast , but the film was always focused on Ringo and Dallas . Here , John Wayne is just one of the stars . Thomas Mitchell , who played Doc Washburn in Stagecoach , has a role that's as big as Wayne's in Voyage . Others are as prominent . The plot is also pretty tenuous and episodic . And , unlike most films of the time , the focus was not on a goal , but just on the events and lives of the seaman aboard the Glencairn . We see them sail through the war-torn Atlantic , between the U . S . and Europe . They have fun , they fight , they talk about home . It's all rather gentle and beautiful , very subtle . The script is great , which is probably due to Eugene O'Neil , for of whose plays this film is based on ( they are blended together seamlessly ) . The actors are marvelous . Mitchell and Wayne are probably the best known , but there are also Ian Hunter , Barry Fitzgerald , John Qualen , Ward Bond , Mildred Natwick , and many other great character actors . John Wayne was probably the draw , considering how popular Stagecoach had made him , but , as I said , his role is not out in the front . In fact , he doesn't have many lines . His schtick is that he is a Swede who can't speak English well , so he is generally pretty quiet ( Wayne can't muster the best Swedish accent , either , so that's kind of a good thing ! ) . He has one great scene where he has some long bits of dialogue . But even without the dialogue , he emotes so well in his face . I knew his character intimately by the end of the film . We don't often think of Wayne as a great actor , but he certainly was . Although The Searchers probably contains his best role , The Long Voyage Home would certainly be worth a major mention when talking about his career . If you could say that there is a single " star " of this film , that would have to be Greg Tolland . Of course , he photographed Citizen Kane in the next year , as well as Ford's Best Picture winning How Green Was My Valley and The Grapes of Wrath . The cinematography is some of the most impressive to be found in the American cinema . John Ford himself is just as much the star of The Long Voyage Home . He definitely put his heart into this one . The direction is beautiful , artful . It is as good here as it is in The Grapes of Wrath , My Darling Clementine , and The Searchers , that is , it is one of his very best films , if not THE best . To date , it's the only Ford film that made me shed tears . .
Entirely Underrated . The Best Kurosawa Film I've Ever Seen	I have been exploring the works of Akira Kurosawa for about 6 months now , and I have seen most of those films which are generally considered masterpieces of film . There wasn't one of his films that I felt surpassed classics like 2001 , Citizen Kane , Raging Bull , or The Godfather . The one I had felt was the best was Ran , his adaptation of King Lear . But now I've found one that I believe is among the ranks of the classics of cinema . And oddly enough , Dreams is not considered a masterpiece . Maltin only gives it . I give it a square . I was skeptical at first . The first three pieces were nice , but I didn't find them extraordinary . The fourth one , " The Tunnel , " began to interest me , and about half-way through that one , I realized that putting dreams to film made a lot more sense than I had originally thought . I began to examine them from a psychological point of view . I became obsessed with the first three , diving deeply into them for their meanings , coming up with pearls of wisdom . I think this film affected my unconscious mind more than most films . Only 2001 , which works on every level , conscious , subconscious , and unconscious , simultaneously ( and it is alone among films in that respect ) , is similar . I will not go into any of the plots . One should experience everything in this film with no preconceptions . Besides , no one should on this site ; these comments ought to be only about why or why not the commenter liked the film he / she is commenting on . Just rent it , sit down , and let your mind absorb the beautiful images and the half-coherent thoughts expressed . When you fall asleep afterwards , you will certainly have the best dreams you've ever had .
Probably the best of all the Mickey Mouse shorts	I was obsessed with this cartoon when I was a child , and now that I have the new DVD box set " Mickey Mouse in Living Color , " I can watch it every day ! This is just filled to the brim with some of the funniest jokes Disney ever created . The animation is simply gorgeous , as it always was in this era of Disney Studios . .
The best film I've seen so far from 2004	Jonathan Rosenbaum theorized that critics liked Sideways so much is because it was about critics , and that it appealed specifically to them . He's right . I'm sure every critic is someone who wished they could have been a director or screenwriter , but couldn't make it . But I say , so what ? The film wouldn't appeal to them if it weren't insightful to the plight of its protagonist . I was expecting Payne to tease and ridicule Paul Giamatti's character throughout the film , because the tastes and skills of an oenophile sound superficially pretentious . For the first time , Payne restrains himself completely in this regard , and just lets the character live . On the other hand , the Thomas Haden Church character is often used for cheap jokes . He's a shameless womanizer who thinks nothing of spinning lies to get laid . However , we've all known people like him . Much like Giamatti in the film , I've only ever been partially disgusted with this type's behavior . In a way , it's fascinating , because I see these skills of manipulation that I don't understand at all . The biggest question of the film is why these two guys are friends at all . They don't seem to have anything in common . But that question enhances the film more than inhibits it . It's one of the things that makes it truly interesting . Sandra Oh ( who deserves a better career than she has ) and Virginia Madsen are both good , though , in my mind , their characters were never as interesting as Giamatti's and Church's . Church , who was very good on the sitcom Wings ( I'd say he's the best thing to come out of that , but Tony Shaloub also got his start there ) , is very funny . But Giamatti makes the movie . His performance is , in itself , a masterpiece . It's easily the best performance by an actor this year . It's an absolute travesty that he wasn't nominated for an Academy Award . .
One of the best of its sub-genre and probably the best movie George Lucas has yet ( read " ever " ) directed	Sure , Star Wars is a lot of fun . It's a great way to waste some time or to keep people entertained at a party or something . However , it's unbelievable how crazy people have become about it . In fact , people are so insanely in love with it that they actually convinced themselves that The Phantom Menace was a good movie . Now that's the power of persuasion ! Let's travel back in time three entire decades . In 1970 , George Lucas made his first feature after graduating from film school . Francis Ford Coppola , two years away from capturing one of the greatest films ever made , helped young Lucas produce it . It is THX 1138 , which is the name given to the film's hero , played by Robert Duvall , who was not yet extraordinarily famous ( perhaps people would recognize him from Robert Altman's MASH , in which he had co-starred earlier that year ) . The setting is a post-apocalyptic , underground complex . I have to throw out a caveat right here : I'm a sucker for post-apocalyptic movies , and generally like all of them . And , in my opinion , this is one sci-fi sub-genre where the cheaper a production is , the better it is . My favorite ever is L . Q . Jones ' 1975 cult classic A Boy and His Dog . Heck , I even liked Robert Altman's Quintet quite a bit . What I like about these three films , what they have in common , is that they don't spend a lot of time explaining their back-stories . A Boy and His Dog gives a brief account of the major event in its history , but does not explain what came afterwards . THX 1138 is surely much more widely known than either A Boy and His Dog and Quintet , simply because of its creator . Lucas ' film gives us hardly anything to establish its setting in time . Of course , as conventions would determine , we all assume that it was some nuclear holocaust or unbearable pollution . But Lucas really gives us little information about what is going on . When sub-genres get so specific like this , where one film is so close to its predecessors , whether those predecessors are films or even novels ( no one could mistake the 1984ish tones of the film ) , the screenwriter and director really don't have to tell us much . So if these films are so close , why should anyone like them ? Well , because you're not supposed to rely wholly on the plot for the films ' worth . This is cinema , not literature . What we have to pay attention to is , well , one , the narrative structure , that is , how the story develops , not what the story is ( that's a part of literature , too , but it's a good variable in this genre ) . Two , these stories do differ in their settings , which is a major part of the authors ' creativity . Three , cinematic techniques . Well , THX 1138 can be credited with having a very good structure . It does progress linearly , but , as I said above , it gives just the tiniest hints of what's actually happening in the film and what the characters are thinking . There is very little dialogue , and a lot of it is difficult to decipher . The setting : George Lucas has great success here . He has all the sets as white as possible , and these sets mostly consist of hallways . Very cheap , and very effective . This comes in a lot if you're going to discuss the cinematography . Lucas also makes his characters wear white , scientific outfits , often covering everything but the characters ' heads or faces . In possibly the best sequence in the film , Duvall is put in a prison that has no visible walls or corners or doors or anything . It's just pure white , and it's simply deafening . And since the prisoners are wearing white , too , it looks like they're all lost in some sort of hideous limbo . Lucas also creates the best visual compositions in his entire career . Star Wars is rather bland visually . Nice colors , I suppose , but there's hardly any attention paid to composition . I was lucky enough to see THX 1138 in widescreen , and Lucas very carefully composed the shots . He's especially good here at posing his actors in an artistic way , while not making it obvious that he had deep artistic intentions when directing them . To tell you the truth , I couldn't relate what actually happens in this story at all . I have to blame part of that on my sleepiness tonight . However , even when I didn't fully understand it , I recognize it as a great movie , a masterpiece , perhaps . .
One of the best films of 2004	The most underrated film of 2004 is this subtle , powerful and sad little independent starring Kevin Bacon . He plays a man just out of jail after 12 years ; he was there because he molested pre-teen girls . The movie perfectly captures the mind and existence of this man . His life is impossible . He can't look another human being in the eye . Only one person from his life before he was discovered will even talk to him . Everyone he works with is inherently suspicious of him , and , since his record is easily available over the internet , it's only a matter of time before everyone knows . The police are watching him , and a certain officer stops by to check on him ? and harass him ? at regular intervals . And of course , you can't feel too sorry for the guy . What he did was revolting . But the film really lets us know what it feels to be besieged by the past and your own shame . And also by your own desires . The desire for young girls does not leave Bacon . He even finds a woman ( played by Bacon's wife , Kyra Sedgwick ) , damaged in her own way and sorry for him , but it can't rewire his brain . All he can do is fight it , a task that becomes difficult as his life starts to collapse around him . The film's main focus is on Bacon's internal struggle . The painful romantic relationship that the two co-workers develop is exceptionally done . There is also a subplot ? one that many a review has focused in on ? where Bacon notices a man trying to lure a young boy into his car day after day . There's one major misstep , in my estimation , where Bacon describes this man's actions in a sports play-by-play style , and maybe a couple of things I questioned along the way ( Bacon moves in across from a grade school ? there are laws preventing this ) , but the rest nears perfection . Kevin Bacon , always a competent actor , gives a career best , and possibly the year's best performance . Sedgwick is also wonderful , if a tad too pretty to be playing this character . There are some surprising actors in the supporting cast ( if you enjoy Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon ? ) , but they are all excellent . The director , Nicole Kassell , delivers a masterwork in her first outing in feature length cinema .
Pretty amazing	Robert Florey's Loves of Zero is , as we are told by an opening placard , " an impressionist film made for less than $200 . 00 . " And that it is ! Great-Grandpappy was right , though . You used to get a heck of a lot for your money back in the good old days . This is mostly just a few friends having a ball on film , playing with the potentialities . It's reminiscent of Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou in that way , except it's not meant to piss us off . The film is goofy , and it knows it , but it is also very beautiful and , ultimately , very poetic . It's certainly a short film that deserves to be more widely known . Just think of how many small masterpieces - or even large ones - from this time period have been lost . Loves of Zero has not been lost , but it might as well be . .
Cave Canem	Any film that affects me emotionally I consider great . But a film that affects me so much that I feel it physically can be called a masterpiece . Narrative does not normally have such power . When a spectator is learning about people who aren't directly connected with you , who are usually not even real , then he / she should realize that these characters are apart from your life and should not matter . Woody Allen's Husbands and Wives is a film , however , which sets the viewer in the action on screen . He does this with perfect hand-held cameras and jump cuts . The camera work makes you feel like you're right there , and it adds a breakneck speed to the film . This seems like one of the most realistic films ever made . I have no complaints about this film myself . I would give it a , but make no mistake : this is a very unpleasant film to watch . I like unpleasant films , but this one is particularly harsh . The situations develop like a fly landing in a Venus fly trap . A character will walk towards a life which he / she believes will bring sweetness and happiness , but the new life quickly engulfs them . And when the film ends , the characters are seen stepping into a different trap : quicksand . No audience member could be naive enough to think that any of the characters are standing in a desirable place when the film closes . Husbands and Wives is a movie that could cause divorces , and could cause long-term lapses between relationships . If nothing else , it is a film that will make you cringe and squirm .
Musical masterpiece	This is probably my favorite Best Picture winner of all time , with its only competition being The English Patient . It's hard to say exactly what makes this one so good for me , because its flaws are pretty obvious . Gene Kelly is way too aggressive when he first pursues Leslie Caron , almost in a creepy sort of way . It doesn't help that he's over twice her age . And the way Nina Foch is treated is pretty cruel . Most of that I attribute to the culture under which it was made . Plus , combined with the ecstatic feeling I get with the reunion of Jerry and Lise , I think the sadness I feel for Milo as well as Henri gives the film a wonderful bittersweet tone . The musical numbers are uniformly fantastic . The standout is Kelly's " I've Got Rhythm " with the little kids - I love " Singin ' in the Rain " , but this one blows it out of the water . And of course the 18 minute ballet that ends the film is the tour de force of tours de force . To me , it's the epitome of dance , music and cinema .
Surely he can't hit two homeruns in a row , can he ?	John Cameron Mitchell had a lot to live up for after his debut film , Hedwig and the Angry Inch . Since that film was based on a play and a character he created and perfected over many years , one had to wonder whether he had anything besides that left in him . Fortunately , his second film , Shortbus , lived up to my nearly impossible-to-attain expectations . It centers around several New Yorkers and their sex lives . Among the main characters are Sofia , a sex therapist who has never achieved orgasm , a gay couple both named Jamie , and a dominatrix who goes by the name Severin ( the revelation of her real name is one of the film's funniest moments ) . These people meet at a sex club called Shortbus . The film is already infamous for featuring unsimulated sex scenes . It's easily the most graphic film I've ever seen ( not counting actual pornography ) , but because of Mitchell's humanism and the love which he and his cast ( who co-wrote the screenplay ) have for the characters , it never seems exploitative . I'm not sure I would say it was absolutely necessary , but it's possible the film wouldn't quite carry the same weight that it does without it . By depicting the acts for real , Mitchell is showing that there is nothing at all to be ashamed of . Watching Shortbus , I realized how strangely every other movie that is explicitly about sex treats its subject . Sex is supposed to be something that's joyous , but think of any other movie featuring a lot of sex ? In the Realm of the Senses , Breaking the Waves , Salo , even Last Tango in Paris ? sex is always something that is painful , something that , at its core , is about hurt . It's either about inflicting pain or trying to heal emotional scars ? and in the latter case it pretty much always fails . Even actual pornography depicts sex as something that is about violence . While most of the characters in Shortbus are unsatisfied in one way or another , the sex they have is not depicted as a false sense of hope . The movie unabashedly treats sex as something that is good for people . I once knew a man who told me that sex and love have nothing to do with each other . Shortbus is about the connection between the two . It's the rare movie , perhaps the only movie , that actually sees a connection between them . The movie's most famous line may turn out to be " It's like the ' 60s , but with less hope , " but , for the life of me , I haven't seen a more hopeful film in a long while . It's a breath of very fresh air , and a fantastic source of inspiration . Hedwig and the Angry Inch was a revolutionary film about gender identity in the 21st Century . Mitchell's second film may turn out to be a revolution on the 21st Century's attitude toward sex . A masterpiece .
Exceptionally funny	After the lamentably unseen The First Time , the next Frank Tashlin movie showing at my local revival theater was Susan Slept Here . I was sure that SSH could not live up to the high standard set by the first film . But it did , and surpassed it . Personally , I think it's one of my five or ten favorite comedies . Dick Powell ( whom I've always loved ) stars as Mark Christopher , a Hollywood screenwriter who hasn't had any success after winning an Oscar ( which , incidentally , serves as the narrator ) . He once had an idea to write a serious picture ( as opposed to the frivolous comedies that he has specialized in ) about a juvenile delinquent , which he mentioned to a policeman friend of his . Well , on Christmas Eve , that policeman , along with his partner , shows up at Mark's door with a 17 year-old juvenile delinquent as a present . Her name is Susan ( Debbie Reynolds , whom I also love , almost desperately ! ) , and the policeman proposes that Mark hang around her for a couple of days , you know , for research . He's in a hurry to take his girlfriend ( the gorgeous but ferocious Anne Francis , who would star in Forbidden Planet a couple of years later ) out on a date , but that comes to an abrupt halt when Susan answers Mark's phone . You know the schtick : Mark starts out annoyed at Susan , but they grow attached . The age difference is brought up frequently enough so it doesn't get too creepy . Mark is 35 ( [ laugh ] - maybe when Powell was dancing with Busby Berkeley ) and Susan is 17 ( Reynolds was 22 at the time , but she is probably the only actress who could get away with playing a teenager until she was in her 40s ) . For a very long time Mark doesn't respond to Susan's crush . The only major flaw in the film - and even it's acceptable - is Mark's motivation in marrying Susan . He does it , he says , to save her from six months jail time ( she has been arrested for assault on a sailor and vagrancy ) . It's not very believable , but it's also not that big a deal . The two leads are exceptional . This was Powell's last movie . After it , he retired to television , although I only call it retirement as a movie snob ; he was enormously , enormously successful in the new medium . He's more or less the straight man here . He has a particularly great scene where he watches a 20 year-old movie for which he wrote the dialogue on television . As the actors speak their horrendous dialogue , we watch Powell as he mouths their words , both a man's and a woman's ( it's a break-up scene ) , with an embarrassed look in his eyes . If Powell is good , Reynolds is masterful . She's such an odd actress , not conventional in any way . She had her own niche in Hollywood . Her acting is doll-like with its jerky movements and huge facial expressions . That isn't a criticism whatsoever . I have never seen her in a straight drama ( the closest is How the West Was Won ) ; I'd imagine she acts differently , or she never made one . In comedies like this and Singin ' in the Rain , she's absolutely perfect . There is not a moment when she's on screen during which I was not laughing myself to tears . The film also has one of the greatest supporting casts ever . Anne Francis I've already mentioned . I very much appreciate the fact that the writers didn't make her character abominable ; Susan Slept Here , although it's not a musical , is very much a direct descendent of An American in Paris and Singin ' in the Rain . One criticism I have of Singin ' is that Jean Hagan's villain is too cartoonish ( or at least I would have that criticism if Hagan weren't so damn funny in that movie ) . Francis in SSH is played sympathetically for the most part . Glenda Farrell plays Mark's secretary , Maude , an alcoholic who answers the telephone on Christmas morning : " You talk , I can't . " Alvy Moore is Mark's friend and assistant , Virgil , who can crack wise with the best of them . Horace McMahon and Herb Vigran play the two cops , and Les Tremayne plays Mark's lawyer , who is obsessive about his therapy sessions . Red Skeleton has a wordless but amusing cameo as Maude's teenage sweetheart . .
Left me gasping for air . . .	Conventional knowledge has it that the only film of Fellini's worth a damn after 8 ½ is Amarcord . Earlier this afternoon , I would have gladly agreed , but tonight I have discovered that this is a fallacy . I present to you And the Ship Sails On . . . , a film that is not only to be ranked alongside Fellini's permanent , almost unquestionable masterpieces , La Strada , Nights of Cabiria , La Dolce Vita , 8 ½ , and Amarcord , but one to be ranked among the best works in cinema . Perhaps this is the most underrated film ever made by a true master , the man who literally was the first filmmaker to be called " auteur " by Andre Bazin in an article about Nights of Cabiria . I would describe this film as a close relative of Amarcord's . The style of characterization is identical - instead of of a close character study , the sort of characterization most film lovers tend to like , the characters in these two films are drawn more broadly , with more attention paid to unique physical features and behavioral quirks . This is all in an attempt to have the audience identify the characters - or , more precisely , caricatures ( before he made movies , Fellini worked as a caricaturist on the streets of Rome ) - in a stereotypical way . Take Titta's parents from Amarcord - they're whom we might draw if we were asked to draw bickering parents . Take the Duke from And the Ship Sails On - could you imagine a teenage , Teutonic duke any other way than Fellini presents him ? You could also take it the other way - when you see this odd fellow on screen , do you have any doubt that he is Germanic royalty ? The visual style is also similar to Amarcord's - that one was painted with cartoonish colors . And the Ship Sails On is also very colorful , but the palette is more specified here - a beautiful canvas of blue-grays and whites . The narrative styles of the two films differ quite a bit , but still are similar . Amarcord taps the vein of nostalgia - perhaps the most untapped of human emotions - for its affect . And the Ship Sails On seems to be going for absurdist , surreal satire . It's a genre that is more or less dead in the world of cinema , which is why , I assume , this film was such a bomb in 1984 and is relatively unknown today . Why satirize the aristocracy of the WWI era anyhow ? That's a good question , but one that is not difficult to answer . I don't believe that Fellini meant the film as any kind of biting satire . It's all done in fun , although the juxtaposition of the rich with the Serbian refugees , whom the ship's crew finds afloat on sinking rafts one night , does ring with a certain painful and ironic truth about how the rich see the poor . Still , even though we might scoff at the way the aristocrats try to trace the roots of Serbian dances back to ancient times , the scene immediately following it , where those aristocrats go down on the deck to dance with the Serbians , is very entertaining and beautiful . The music in that scene , in fact , the music throughout the entire film , made me want to clap and dance . The actors move rhythmically as they progress through the film . I also have to add that Fellini never made a funnier film , at least of the ones I've seen , which are a majority of them ( Toby Dammit of the omnibus film Spirits of the Dead comes very close ) . Most of this film's greatness lies in individual scenes , and thus , as you might guess , the sum is not exactly equal to the parts - at least as far as I saw , there's no real point - the substance is thin . But when style is this beautiful , I say screw substance . Each individual scene ranks among the best ever put to film - the wine glass concert , the scene where sunlight brightens one half of the ship and moonlight the other , the boiler room scene where the great opera singers compete vocally in order to impress the sailors below , the interview with the duke , and the opera singer's funeral . Each scene is so exquisitely created by Fellini and every other artist involved that it is entirely forgiveable if the audience remembers those individual images rather than an overall effect . For me , the combination did have an overall effect : I was so awestruck that I was weeping , though there was nothing onscreen to weep at . .
The most malleable masterpiece I can think of	I would only suggest the films of Michelangelo Antonioni to those who are extremely serious about film . He is an underappreciated auteur , and this underappreciation comes from the enormous difficulties his films raise . In fact , his films are kind of difficult to find . I've only seen two , L'avventura and Blowup . These are his two most famous and most studied films . If you read down the comments on this page , you'll quickly notice that many people do not like this film . I do not blame them . Initially , it can be boring . In fact , the film becomes more interesting after contemplating it long after it is over . After contemplation , and on subsequent viewings , this film seems a lot better . The same goes for L'avventura . And when you begin to think about , and then when you begin to read other people's comments and opinions , you will instantly notice that there have been dozens and dozens of rather disparate interpretations , with most of them even making sense . This provides a rare treat , an intellectual challenge . POSSIBLE SPOILERS My personal interpretation ( I just finished watching it for the second time , without having seen it for about 3 years ) : Thomas , the photographer , is a man who seems to have everything he wants . He is wealthy ( at least a little ; he does express the desire to be even wealthier at one point ) , and people are at his whim . He treats them whichever way he wants . This especially goes for women . He is a fashion photographer ( THE fashion photographer ; if you ever see a movie or a tv commercial with a man snapping pictures frantically at posing models , it is based on this film ) , so women are practically knocking down his door to get him to manipulate them . It has all become too easy for Thomas . He is like the proverbial spoiled child : having got everything he wanted , he has become profoundly bored with it . Because of this , he runs away from a monotonous shoot to a park , where things happen spontaneously . He chases birds and photographs them . Then , suddenly , eureka ! A couple going about their lives as if no one were watching them . A challenge ! Reality ! Thomas jumps into bushes to get closer , as if a National Geographic photographer glimpsing rare animal behavior . As he is leaving the park , the woman of the couple does notice him , and chases him down for the film . For Thomas , life is again back to normal . He joshes her cruelly , letting her know that he is controlling this situation . Thomas goes back home ( I'm skipping over some important stuff , but I'll stick to the meat ) , where the same woman ( Vanessa Redgrave ) is waiting . Again , he controls the situation , and lets Redgrave know that he is controlling it , finally sending her on her merry way with the wrong film . When she has gone , he develops that film from the park . As he scours it , he discovers that he may have taken pictures of a murder . This does not disturb him . Actually , it excites him , almost sexually . He has been having virtual sex with the women he is seen photographing all through the film , but he only really gets aroused at this ( in fact , an orgy scene which arises a few minutes from this point does little but distract Thomas , and when it is over , he kicks the two women from his home rather forcefully , and then goes straight back to his scouring and blowing-up ) . He is aroused , I believe , because of his inability to truely control this situation . It is like riding a wild stallion . Having blown the photographs up to an abstract mess , Thomas decides that he must examine the murder site . There he finds the body which he believed he saw in his photos . He goes back to his pad , and finds the place ransacked with only the most blown-up photo he has of the incident left behind . It is abstract , and he is instantly unsure whether or not he did see the corpse when he was in the park . He tries desperately to tell his friends , but they could not care in the least ( they joke about it ) . His sexual excitement has transformed into frenzy . He is not used to these sorts of emotions , and has no idea how to control himself now . He goes on a wild goose chase after a woman who looks like Redgrave from the back . A friend , high on pot , finally tells him to relax and go to bed . When Thomas wakes in the morning , he immediately goes back to the park , unsure of his experiences in the past couple of days . No body . The excitement is over . But wait ! A group of mimes ( see Ebert's explanation through the external reviews link ) has started to mime a tennis match nearby . Thomas watches these people simulate the sport . Although neither balls nor rackets exist , Antonioni subtly inserts the sounds of a tennis match in sync with the mimed actions . One of the tennis mimes hits the invisible ball over the tennis court fence , and signals Thomas to go and get it . Thomas does not even question the ball's existence ( Antonioni playfully moves the camera as if the tennis ball is actually in the center , even having the camera bounce after the invisiball has hit the ground ) . This invisible object is no less real than what he is experiencing in everyday life , and also than the games of invisibility that he has been playing for the last couple of days . After Thomas throws the ball back , he wavers . What to do now ? Well , his choice is finally just to disappear . He has completely lost control of the world around him , and his only recourse at this point is simply to null his own existence . He does not do it bitterly ( one of the greatest things about this film is the audience's change in attitude over Thomas ; at first , we despise his cruelty and spoiled nature ; now , we pity him ) , but almost willfully . Nonexistance is not such a bad option sometimes .
One of Ford's very best	An exceptional film from John Ford ( what else should I expect ? ) . This one is set during the American Revolution , around 1776 , in the frontier area of the Mohawk River Valley ( Ohio ? ) . A British soldier named Caldwell ( John Carradine ) has come to pay the Indians of the area to make war against the Americans . Among them are Gil and Lena Martin , who have just recently married and are now trying to build a life for themselves . When the Indians ravage their farm , they are forced to move in with Mrs . McKlennar ( Edna May Oliver , in a great role ) , a benevolent widow . This is a part of American history that hasn't been adequately covered , and this is easily the best film like this that I've seen ( even if it might be the only ) . The setting is beautifully created . Ford often focuses on the strict procedures of the military , but here we see armed forces that are rather hastily thrown together . There are a couple of great action sequences , but perhaps the most memorable piece of the film is Fonda's vivid telling of a bloody battle . I like his dazed look and tone , and the fact that , even when there's no one really listening to him , he stumbles through the horrific story as if its telling is all that matters in the world . Henry Fonda did much of his best work with John Ford , and this is up there right next to his Tom Joad in the next year's The Grapes of Wrath . Claudette Colbert is an actress whose popularity has steadily declined since the studio system fell . It's not too much of a tragedy . I mean , she's not a bad actress , of course , but she just looks . . . fake . I admit that I haven't seen too many of her performances . I like her most in The Palm Beach Story - comedy suits her well . She's adequate in Drums Along the Mohawk , but I would probably refer to her as the weak link in the picture . Even as the weak link , Colbert doesn't harm the final product much at all ( perhaps , though , if a great actress had landed the role the film wouldn't be as forgotten today as it seems to be ) . Ford regular Ward Bond has a choice role , one that seems like it was meant for Victor McLaglen ( who had one of his most memorable roles that year in Gunga Din ) . Still , Bond was a character actor with an amazing range , and he is quite good as the loud but lovable lout . .
The mother of all melodramas !	I just finished watching the recent reconstruction of this film that was commissioned by TCM a couple of years ago . Everyone knows the history of this film , at least everyone who's ever heard of it . Von Stroheim's first cut was about nine and a half hours long . MGM , of course , couldn't release such an enormous monster . No one would be willing to sit down for that long in a theater except maybe Erich von Stroheim ! They demanded that he cut it , and he complied . The second cut was around four hours long . Still to long , MGM shouted . They took it away from him and cut it down to around two and a half hours , which was still fairly long for the time , though not unprecedented ( think D . W . Griffith ) . Von Stroheim was outraged . Because of this film , and also other films that he attempted to make in the same era , he was eventually disallowed ever to direct another film in Hollywood . Of course , he made at least two memorable appearances as an actor , first in Jean Renoir's The Grand Illusion and then in Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd . For seventy-some years , the 2 . 5 hour version of Greed circulated . From what I can tell , it was much beloved , but somewhat difficult to follow . Cineastes pray to God that the missing reels are someday found , but the hope is never strong , because that would be quite impossible . But now this new version exists , with missing pieces filled in by publicity stills . It can actually be quite confusing , especially in the first half or so . I still want to see the 2 . 5 hour cut sometime , so I can see what was dropped and see if the remaining film is coherent . It took me a long time , at least an hour and a half , to start to appreciate Greed . Four hours is quite an investment , and I was growing weary for a long while . But after a certain point the film just gets better and better . The film is basically a long melodrama . A man and a woman get married . We experience their trials and their hardships . Both of these characters are overcome with greed . The wife becomes a miser . She has won $5000 in a lottery , but she demands that it stay in the bank and accumulate interest . Meanwhile , she and her husband go poor with that money sitting idle . The husband , on the other hand , spends every nickle he has as soon as he gets a hold of it . Elsewhere , we are given two more examples of the effects of money on people . A Mexican woman ( the one who sells the wife the lottery ticket ) drives a junkyard manager , her husband , wild with mythic stories of hidden treasures . In another subplot , an old man learns that his hobby is worth something and he gets $5000 , enough to court his neighbor , an aging , unmarried woman . These subplots will not be found in the original cut of the film . By the end of the long journey , I realized that I absolutely loved Greed . I immediately began to pray that someday every meter of the film will be recovered . I know it'll be a fruitless hope , but there are worse things to wish for ! .
