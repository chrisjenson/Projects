Political correctness meets Hollywood	Political correctness meets Hollywood destroys the truth . I know Hollywood adds to stories to make them more entertaining , but this movie is a lie . Why must some people in the entertainment field re-write or falsify history . I was looking forward to watching a film about the Nightstalker , which I read , watched a tv movie , and real life cop shows about . They had the races of everyone wrong , detectives , killer etc . The detectives were more like what you see on investigative reports on A & E . The woman character is totally fabricated ( copy Silence of the Lambs ) along with the story itself . The police did release the composite after rationally discussing the pros and cons , while the Nightstalker was in Phoenix . He came back to LA , and was captured by the public . What is with the head giggling bit , it looked like a rock video , and the awful camera work . What cop borrows the police cruiser with a case of beer in civilian clothes . I gotta go camping this weekend can I borrow the police cruiser . The police would not go to the woman officer's house , if there was danger . I wonder about modern media , if they can do this to a real life film what do they do to the news ? it should be a
Awful ! Do not waste your money .	This film is awful . I rented it because at our store it was $0 . 99 Thursday rental . The movie was very slow paced and did not keep one's attention . Robert Vaughn has got to be one of the worst actors . Has he ever done anything other than B movies . No . He is that bad . Donald Pleasence was casted , but had such a small role that one could not judge his abilities . The only part I did like was the brick work which is movie is loosely based on .
Saw it on horror movie week	This film is worse than Cat People , which I saw during the same week . It has all the 80's style . MTV punk rockers , the real ones who are anti social , not todays PC commercial type , frat boys , and a bad guy called Splater . I really like Splater , and the film does that blue lighting 80's feel , but the rest of it looks like low budget Canadian schlop . I have seen so much of this while living in this great country , and realize these type of movies were made because of Tax breaks . Avoid at all costs .
Unwatchable movies from unreadable books	Unwatchable movies from unreadable books . What worse than watching this movie . I believe I will find out I have to read 3 books about this story for my college English class . Maybe , this is not my type of movie ; the story unravels painfully slow . The story has very little explanation or direction . Focuses on depression with out reason . To dry for me .
Great acting bad story	Candy and Hanks act well in this stinker , but have no material to work with . Tom plays a rich snob who joins the peacecore to avoid paying some debts . Great idea , but no script to work with . Even John Candy's nerd character can not say this one . Flush this stinker down the toilet .
Lame dumb stupid	Spoiler I can watch a movie and let the unbelievable bend , but this movie went way to far . At least Hannable is mean in this film unlike the new movie entitled Hannable . When Hannable can surgically chew some guards face off and put it on his perfectly and no one notices , thats just to lame for me . How can this guy figure out what other criminals can do and whole room of FBI profilers can't . Would you trust him even . Jodi Foster and the guy have these weird deep conversations all the time . Boring I can her the same weirdness on the bus on my way to work . Like all copies of a copy this movie is awfuller then the original and then next version is even more stupid , and if they make a fourth , Hannable will probably be on the space shuttle . I give this a 3 .
Burn every copy of this film please	This film is so bad I forgot I saw it before ? My dad rented in in grade 10 and we shut it off . This time it was on the History Channel , and my memory returned . I would rate it lower , but I did not see the second half , my stomach would not allow it .
Preview better than movie	Do not rent this dog of a movie , the preview is a lie . No suspense , or real character development . The movie insults the viewer's intelligence , I know it is only a movie , but people get shot with no effect , can rip dogs apart etc I find the movie crosses over into stupid land . The family was unlikeable with the swearing , and over top behaviour . I find the mutants , like the one at the end that gets shown too many times way too much . I work at the post office and find weirdos more annoying than scary . The movie tries to shock or gross one out , maybe the movie will make the viewer feel unpleasant , but not scare him or her . The only part I like were the beautiful dogs , but the rest of the film is a weirdo fantasy not a story style of film . 3 0ut of 10 . Not even worth a second feature on rental night .
4 . 6 is about right .	Bronson took the money and ran with this film ; he must have house payments like me ! This low budget film made in Mexico reminds me of a few of those Italians stinkers from over seas . I heard , I do not know if this is true , but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes . I believe this because why else would they make this film , it sure wasn't to make money . We had a whole lot of these Canadian made stinkers , because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry . I wonder if it payed off in the other countries like in Canada . Anyway , back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect , I believe they grabbed Charles Bronson in order to sell this stinker ; that dead body at the end looks very phony .
Not Good	I believe the makers where trying to copy the movie The Deep , which is repeatedly shown on TBS . Not much of a story , and looks like the film makers produced , this future 99 cent rental , on the quick . The characters were unlikeable , and why was the bar scene shot ? I guess they were trying to make the film into a hunk and babe beach fest . No real mystery or suspense in this film . I would not even rent it on 99 cent night . The preview looks better than the movie . Into the blue could kill a few acting careers . Has Paul Walker done any decent movies ? He is not a bad actor but needs help in selecting the roles he picks . Wasn't he in Joy Ride ? Now that was an interesting movie and good selection on his part .
STAY AWAY ! Slow	If you have seen Jacob's Ladder , you will just see another version of the same old story . If you did not like Jacob's Ladder , like myself , STAY away ! I have previously seen Jacob's Ladder so I could see the ending about through the movie . Watching my wife's body almost completely shut down when she had her stroke , did not help with watching the movie . No matter how hard one tries to water down such a concept , most people will leave the experience cold . Even if one views the experience of mortality in a positive tone , the feeling will always be cold . How does one know what the mind does if it shuts down . Where did they get the concept from ? I hate how the movie races and becomes delusional . The background is sterile and cold . Watch the apartment or office background and you will get the picture . The movie's delusions made me feel annoyed , and the end left me cold . Stay away from this film ! The movie will leave you cold .
Good actors Lame story	Jeff Goldblum seem to like playing bad guys in Charlie's films . He gets back at Goldblum for the Death Wish film . A few good scenes , and good b actors . This film has one of those 70's films that makes little sense . I would not rent this one again , it seem the 70's made many films with huge holes in the scripts
I can only watch this show for about 3 minutes .	I can only watch this show for about 3 minutes . I remember , back in the day , going to battle of the bands , and what I am watch is a televising version of the latter . I must be getting old say back in the day . The entertainment is similar to the bar bands grade B . OK but I can not watch a full hour of the show . Another rendition of Star Search ! There is some humor in the show ; and people love to watch others bomb or go down in flames . I believe we love to watch people burn for it makes us not feel so bad about ourselves . When others stink we feel good knowing we could do better or the same . I just find the show too much hype . Simon could use a chill pill . Simon . Simon what are you doing ? I guess Simon must know people for Simon's made a lot of money of Idol .
First half OK	The first half of the movie is interesting , then I fell asleep . I gave the first half a . Then my wife watch the second half and said the movie got bogged down . The slow pace , and lack of story was too much and killed the movie . Not even a rental she told me . Costner is a fading star . I can not name the last good movie Costner has done . I bet Costner will be doing direct to video movies next . Mr Whatever , I forgot the name of it , only lasted a week in the movie house . I did not want to rent it . Mr Whatever is starts . Not even a second rental . I guess when I fell asleep that was a good sign not to watch it .
lame	Forgetable movie with forgetable characters . This film is done on a low budget , and it shows . A few bright spots in the film , where the viewer will laugh . The story is predictable and the conclusion is no surprise . Good second feature to rent when every one is drunk after having a few beers while watching the first feature .
I wish they would let this series die !	Better than the last one , but not that much better . I saw this one as the second of three features at the Drive Inn . A lot of this film is by the numbers . Sappy , PCish , and lame . More like what one would see on some 70's TV cop show . The few moments that make this film better than the last one is Freeway scene , and the beginning with the flame thrower guy . The rest is just rehash . Oh by the way , that Karate guy is quick . Gibson should have ran away from him . I'll give it a PS Joe Peschi does not add any humor too this film , except the cell phone bit with Chris Rock .
A sport I love	Another awful movie about hockey . I if never watched hockey and saw Hollywoods version , I would hate the game . This movie doesn't make Canada look that great either . I can laugh at it and not take it too seriously . All the same this movie is awful , with every thing you can put in a 80's movie . In the end don't even watch it on TV .
Seen worse but seen better .	Do not go out and see the Haunting of Molly Hartly . Predictable , boring and anti climatic is the traits of the H of M H . Acted OK , and directed OK . I will not say the movie was made bad , but the movie makers had bad material to work with . The movie got across as a 70's low budget , made for TV movie of the week , which the audience would see on late night TV . I get the ending where Molly is evil . Not scary , or even a shock with the ending . Everyone was evil in this film . I still thinks Molly had a choice in the end free will . I give this film a . I think maybe me spending money on this stinker is the scariest part of the movie .
Not that great !	Gut feeling tells me that they left some of the truth out of this story ! They made the killer look nicer , and less crazy than real life . Who can say what makes one do these horrible deeds . Genes or environment whatever . I am sure there is a point where people snap in life . I found some of the film interesting , but the rest of the story has a 70's misunderstood bad guy theme to it . I find working at the post office with some very bitter people in it scary and unsettling ; they have a mean streak or hatred for the world I found missing in this film . The movie ' In cold blood ' is a better portrayal for this topic . Some of her victims were not the best quality people , but I sure hate to ever get in the way of this enraged , bitter woman . I find bitter people create more carnage , where I prefer the situation defused . Don't bother with this one .
Not bad but shows its age	Saw this film on TBS . Still entertaining , but dated . It was interesting to watch the football scenes , I love the game . The split screen part I just totally hate . Some of the lines and actor where a little to unbelievable for the realistic 00's we live in now . The ending is great , and the movie is worth a watch I give it a .
Gad will this film ever end	It's too long , and stupid . It could have been a comedy with that scene with Joe Pesci being whipped . How could he have a straight face while filming that scene . Funny part John Candy plays the only believable straight role in this film . I did fall asleep before this one ended . No before you ask , I am not with the government , who is trying to spread some misinformation ! I do not know what's with Oliver Stone , but after this , and some of the scenes from Any Given Sunday and Nixon I am surprised this guy doesn't do a film on UFO " s .
Not as good as the Original	I found the story in Death Wish 2 to simular to the original . Maybe , if I saw 2 first I would give it a higher rating . This film is brutal , but crime is brutal ; I think the director did this , as in the original , not as a selling point but too show the brutality of crime on the victim , and the remorselessness of the criminal . This make me understand why Walsh does America Most Wanted . Criminals , the dogs they are , do these things , and gives the more protected liberal minded person and idea of the kinds of animals the police deal with . This movie is not for kids ! Should something this honest be made ? I do not know the answer . This part of the movie show why Bronson snaps . The only difference in this film from the original is this time Bronson gets a look at the , anus , criminals and hunts them down . One other viewer thinks the bad guys act too strange , normal people do not do these things , but crazy people act crazy . What hurts this film , besides the script , is the editing and music . I like the 80's LA feel , but the film is choppy or rushed . The directing is good , but who ever edited this ouch .
Low low low budget	Except for John , and Vin this would have been another low budget movie in the 99 cent rental bin . John does a great role here , and Vin's plan of beating the toughfest guy in town is the only believable part in this film . However , thoes 2 actors could not save this film . Watch on 99 cent Wednesday at your local video store .
Not bad	I like history movies , so I like this one . Nice change for Van Damm he plays a different role . The film is interesting to follow . We have the reasons why people joined , and the harshness of being one . A solid 6 , and I would watch this film when they show it on TBS .
Not as good as we own the night	The comeback of 70's style movies is in full swing . Maybe 3-D movies will be next . I like the sound track , feel , and pace of the movie . Washington is a OK actor , and the rest of the cast is good . Crowe plays a strong role , but the script seem to typecast Crowe into a flat character . The script is strong , and the shoot out is memorable . Borlin shines playing a dirty cop . A true standout performance . The stages , camera angles , and diolouge is right out a 70's cop show . I liked the movie . I found We Own the Night had a slicker feel and more tension . I would rent Americian Gangster , but buy We Own the Night . . Good for a Saturday movie night .
They showed all the good stuff on the trailer	Spoiler They showed all the good stuff on the trailer . Shouldn't ruined it for us the viewer . Anyways ok but predictable . I like the phone part . " This is readers " good line . I wish there was more to this movie , but there isn't . I would rent it . I like the tv part too It's Ok !
Average action film	Average action film . Some very good scenes with Johny Depp , and a lot of symbolism . The director must love Mexico ; he sells the country well . There is some memorable material , but and there is one that I have seen a lot of the material before . I've seen one too many action films ; they need to reinvent themselves . I give this a .
Fairly tense	The film was different from the first in that you were not watching the first film over ie . Men in Black 1st and 2nd . I missed the song in this film " Jeepers Creepers where did you get those peepers . " They did not have it in this sequel . No big name actors in this one . It was more like the older monster movies . The ending was different and left room for part three . They showed the best scenes on the trailer so it kind of ruined the film for me . 6 or
Average action movie !	This is your average action movie . Partner killed , everyone acts over macho etc . Jet-li did not get to use much of his fighting skills . A few good plot twists . War reminds me of the Hong Kong style action films , with some over the top gun and fight action . The story is compelling enough for the viewer to follow . However , ' War ' is another action films where one turns their brain off , and gets one's heart pumping . I have seen better action films . War is no Lethal Weapon . Wait for video . The car action is worth renting . The movie has a wow ending . . Rent ' Marked for Death ' or ' Blood Sport ' instead . When will Jet-li get a great role to play in ?
Too many comic book movies out now	They had Spiderman , the Hulk and Daredevil . What is next ? There is nothing new to this type of movie . Super hero saves people . The only bright spot was Colin Farrell . Who is a good actor . I have not seen him in a bad performance yet or even pick a bad role for himself . Ben Affleck is not a great actor . I could do without seeing him in this role . At least J LO wasn't in the film . I think Val Kilmer could of done a much better job .
Not a bad movie .	Not a bad movie , but not a great one either . I think the movie might be based off what I read in the paper here in Canada . The story is about how torture creates more hatred . Questions US policy with the war on terror . I have mixed feeling . What do we do with terrorists ? Dealing with evil people always gets ugly . Well directed and acted . I wonder how close the movie is to real life . I wonders what was omitted ? What was added for dramatic effect ? a bit of a downer to watch ! stars . Film in a dark lighting to create the depressing mood . A very dark film . The acting is done more like a stage play than a movie . I like the full circle ending . I get the point .
Not a bad idea	Jackie Chan does some bad movies and some good ones . He is great for comedy . It reminds me of my Asian friends . This is one of his better ones . He has a great sense of humor which he combines with action . So you get a little bit of both . He plays a loser with his Hooters shirt . The story is neat and original . It is worth seeing . Jackie Chan does his trademark action in this film . He is very athletic . I enjoyed seeing this film . It was good for a laugh as well I got my action fix .
Great movie but	This is a great movie , but it lacks something . It was not Tom Cruse's best acting performance , or I did not like Toms character . Well maybe , pilots act this way , but Tom was not a team player , and learned about it ; Val Kilmer was a more liked person , and me with own sin should not cast the first stone because my wife tells me I got a Tom Cruse , top gun attitude so I should not judge . The cast is good you have Michael Ironside , and Tom Skeriet , and the script is good , but not accurate of what happens at top gun , and the story has a moral about growing up along with over coming life obstacles . In the end the jet footage is great , but something just lacked in this film
Forgettable	A forgettable film . Not a bad film , but a forgettable b movie . The second feature at a Driven , heading for the 99 cent bin at a rental store near you . The acting and directing is grade b , but the story and special effects compensate . Pairs Hilton's acting and role is what one lowly expects ; Another reality actor trying to better ones self . The story is interesting and keeps the viewer on track after the typically slow start . Has the usual car trouble , help from someone strange , and there is always a town in this style of movie . House of Wax is second feature after one watchs the good movie . Ammityville is the better of the 2 moves this spring . A 5 or , depending if one is a fan of horror movies . Has a few twists , but nothing special . No surprise the maker did not want this movie to go head to head with Amityville .
More suspense than a horror movie .	I like the movie . A decent Wensdaynight date movie . ' The Eye ' is a horror movie , but also more of a mystery movie . After a eye transplant Jessica Able is able to see the dead . A mystery of who Jessica'a eye donor is ensues . Well directed and acted . The story's mystery is the engine which drives the movies to its suspenseful ending . I was guessing at the ending . Is ' The Ring ' a better movie ? You bet . I still like ' The Eye ' which is a good second feature on DVD night . A 6 or . Not a Texas Chainsaw Masscaure style film . ' The Eye ' is not a gore fest style horror movie . Take ' The Eye ' for what it is ! A mystery style horror movie .
Not bad	360 with Anderson Cooper is not a bad show . The show leans towards the left . They have Lou Doubs , and Glean Beck for equal time . At least , Cooper is not so biased so Cooper shows both sides of a issue . Cooper does not roll around on the ground and act silly like some liberals over some issues . Hillary is a candidate not someone a news journalist acts objectively towards . What's happening and why is how Copper follows Hillary's campaign . Cooper does not have the best voice or most entertaining analog , but Coopers continuity provide a strong balance for the show . . I watch 360 sometimes , and I do not watch news shows anymore . News is too by the numbers with opinions instead of issues which I find uninteresting . I wonder who's news opinion is right . Why is Ted Kennedy's endorsement mean so much for someones campaign . Why is it news worthy ? What about the issues ? What really happened ? In the the truth is objective ? Plato once said what is truth ?
Not enough Jack Sparrow	There was not enough of Jack Sparrow in the movie ! The first story's protagonist Jack Sparrow's personality carried the film . The absence of Sparrow's character kills the movie . The dialog of Jack Sparrow is not as strong as the first movie . I found Jack sparrow's look is like Captain Morgan on the rum advertisement . Could the coincidence be a marketing ploy for rum ? Your guess is good as mine . The movie drags in spots and a little too much fantasy . I believe the movie is more a prequel for the final of the series . The sets and acting were okay . I was tired for the second feature at the drive-in . Thus I appear to be a little critical . With this in mind , wait for the rental . !
Lame , but entertaining all at the same time .	This film is another lame 80's action flick . I loved this film when I was 16 , but as I mature this film gets lamer . Its too over the top . The cheap sets , the sad knife fight , and wooden acting . The story is over the top . What I did like in this comic book film is the humor . Lines like , " Remember when I said I kill you last " " Yes You did " " I lied " " Let off some steam Bennit " " I eat Green berets for breakfast " " Where's what ever his name " " I let him go " . Still funny , but mindless . In the end I give this film a six .
Not as scary as the original	The original film is a slow burn , and builds up . This film , based in a hospital , has some of thoes characteristics , but turns into another Friday the 13th body count film . The ending gets stupid , but the films impact is ok . I would watch it , but would rather watch something else .
Better than the 2nd , but not even close to the original	Spoiler Death Wish one and two's stories were almost identical , and with three they altered the story . This time Bronson is working for the cops , and a full scale riot erupts . I give this movie a five or six depending on my mood . The seriousness of the original is dropped . This is an action film . I can not believe they filmed it in London and made it look like New York . The budget was much higher than the first two films . I was glad when the Creeper got what he deserved .
Watchable	My dad hates this film and I watch it with little expectations and enjoyed it . Not the best movie ever , but I like the grittiness of it . The part where they show him in the bar , and how his life led to his moment with destiny . It is unfair to compare this to Tombstone , when they both came out , because Tombstone is a classic . This film is worth a look . 6 or .
Like a GTA video game !	Like a GTA video game . The movie is similar to ' The Transporter ' with little story melded with continual rapid fire action . The viewer is assaulted with surreal video game style violence . One continual climax of violence is the storyline . One gets a lame explanation of a storyline . Who needs a storyline with this film ! I like the action but I turned my brain off after about five minutes after watching . 6 out 10 . A rental . Owen took the money a ran with this movie . Shootem up will hurt Owen's image . The girl from the bond film always plays a snake of a character . I would rather play GTA vice city with the character of Tommy .
Run of the mill	Another run of the mill movie . The film industry , ( with digital in a few years people will ask what is film ? ) produces too many formulated movies like The Sentinel . Well acted and directed with interesting plot twists , but with a made for TV storyline . Worth renting , as a second feature , but one would never buy the movie . In the line of fire is a better film . In the line of fire was original ten years ago , and has been copied several times over . The Sentinel is comparable to a horror / slasher movie with the formulated deranged killer , and looks dated . Sutherland is becoming a better act than his father . . Don't be on the look out for the Sentinel .
Not bad but not great either .	Friday the 13th is not a bad movie , but not a great movie either . Friday the 13th is just an OK movie . The beginning of the film is strong and scary . The first 3rd of the movie is interesting with Sam Winchester off supernatural looking for his sister . The character just acts like Sam would from the Supernatural series . Then , the viewer loses interest when the story becomes bogged down with character development . I read once they make the characters annoying in the Fridaday 13th series because if the audience become to attached to the characters the audience gets to disturbing watching the film . There where some scares , and tension with the movie . However , I have seen a few of the other 13th movie and a few of the scene in the new movie become predictable . The movie was worth going to I would give Friday the 13th a , or a . I would call this movie a rental or cheap night movie . They still managed to give present film an 80's feel like the older Friday the 13th movies .
This is a fun movie .	Well , having nothing better to do and renting the whole video store out , I went to the horror section , to desperately rented a video I did not see before . It caught my eye , because of the 3-D edge to it , I told my wife what the hell lets rent it , its gotta be better that badly dubbed Italian film Zombi . Anyways , I always wanted to see a 3D film , and when this came out with other 3D films in the early 80's my dad didn't take me to any of them , because the fad ended faster then it began . I tried to envision the 3D as I watched it in 2D , and this film probably was alot freakier in 3D , with the effects of yo-yo's , juggling , flaming cole pokers , spear guns , eye poppings , pitch forks , and flying pop corn . The opening credits would have been great on 3D too . My dad said they got the yo-yo idea from Vincent Price's House of Wax . Not to drag on , I found this movie much better then the first . One the budget is much higher , and two the film does not take it self to seriously . This is a date movie , with alot of cheese in it , they made this film with alot of shock in a humorous way . It had a great post disco theme music , and gags like , ( remember this is before safty seals , and after watching this I am happy they put them on products . ) a store owner who eats and drinks out of containers before resealing them . He eats some of his fish food while feeding the fish , and finds out it has poo in it . The prankster who does stupied trick , to keep you guessing if its the real killer . The pot heads who act like Jim off Taxi . The plot here is not that scary , Jason does not talk , there is no motive , etc , he just walk around and kills . ( well I work at the post office and people do motiveless stupid things all the time , but thats besides the point ) Motives help horror films , and the acting is better then the first , but the actors don't have mush room to play with the script . The ending is a bit scary , but in all this is a movie that will make you laugh at sick humor , more then scare you . 3D shock horror .
Comic book junk food for the mind	Spoiler Well the Stallone bashers are out in full force for this film . I do not mind it ; Stallone does comic book action heros well , Rambo , Judge Dredge , etc . I like these forms of escapism , take them for what they are junk food for the mind . This film is not a steak , its a 7-11 pizza sub sandwich , which goes well with a coke . The begaining is great , after that the story laps into a comic book style , with a high body count ending , along with the big entertaining action movie fight for the climax . I gave it a 6 , as I get older the film gets cheesier like the Pizza sub , but in the macho 80's as a teenager this film would be a 8 . Even as I get older I still watch this one on TBS , and can not stop watching it no matter how many times they show it , until my wife makes me change the channel . Its fun to watch , but its not for everyone , and all the Stallone basher out there , you crap on this guy , but have you seen Hard to kill or Out for Justice by Steagal I mean those are some pretty desperate low budget films .
Just another comedy .	I like Drillbit Taylor . Funny in spots , well direct , and has a interesting story . However , the movie dragged , and some parts were more sad than funny . I believe Owen Wilson's personality carried the movie . The material ( script ) Wilson had to work with is stale , and Wilson added life to a very forgettable film . Comedy is hard to create , and to maintain a comic synergy for over an hour is hard . The movie is watchable , and rent able . Would I buy it ? No ! I did not mind it . The movie is no Caddy Shack , but no Ishtar either . Good cheep Tuesday movie on a cold Canadian night . I think everyone knew a bully and how desperate one gets with them . The way the teachers , and parents do not care or maybe they are just dumb is a little to close to reality . Funny but not in a humorous way . We laugh at them not with them .
Blood and skin . What more could one expect from this title ?	My friend , Tony , put it this way " Skin and Blood " what more could the producers put into this movie to get ratings . The staples of any spring break slash horror movie . What is wrong with you people who complain about this movie with a title " Springbreak Shark Attack " ? Were your expectations that high ? Any 19 year-old or 40 year-old adolescent ( who works at Canada post ) who lives at home with their mother would be glued to the TV screen . Thankfully , I grew out of that stage , but still like a laugh enjoyed this film . Mind you , I only caught the last of this movie . The movie is cheesy , but in a provolone way . Has a decent story with the club owner , and they put the creep / relationship soap opera part in which my wife got involved with deeply and the parent conflict . Actually made the film where everyone watched the story . Everyone new the surf dude with the water recliner and a drink was going get it . Shark time chomp , well that goes with the title . Tension is created with the shark scene , better than most TV with a social message movie Schulz . If " Spring Break Shark Attack " was meant to be entertainment then the goal was achieved . Nothing like HBO or in Canada Showtime exploitation stuff that is just weird , this is very tame compared to cable . .
Better than the Rocks	After watching the newer version , I decided to compare . I loved walking tall when I was a kid . Remembered some of it , but a few years back I caught it on TBS late night . WOW did this film age well ; nothing is better than a true story . My father , or someone I know says the movie is close too the books . Maybe that is why the story and film age well . Realism always lasts the test of time . I had to get some sleep and missed Walking Tall 2 , but hope to cath it on TBS some time soon . Thank you TBS late night from all us insomnia suffers , nothing is worse than info commericals , or old re-runs . This movie is closer too the trues story so I give the new Walking Tall the old 2 by 4 and give the old version a . I think the Rock could play a better bad guy .
Not bad	People will slash this movie apart , but its not that bad . I gave it a 6 , this movie is no scream , its done on a low , and the plot resembles other slasher films , except for a few very smart twists . The strong attributes easily out way these weakness , the acting is believable , the ending is great , and they achieved the late 70's to mid 80's horror feel the film went after . It's entertaining , and for a younger crowd , I will not watch it over and over again , but I did not waste my money renting it either .
Inferior version of Bill and Ted's Excellent adventure !	I remember reading a MAD comic's version of Wayne's World , and it put my review into a nut shell . At the end of the comic , Bill and Ted have Wayne and Garth in a phone booth sent off into oblivion ; while yelling " you stoled our movie " . Funny , but the truth usually is ! Michael Myers , not the guy from Halloween , has written many comical hits , and if he leaves acting will probably keep on writing . This movie is made from a recurring SNL skit . The skit can be funny , but like the hosers of The Great White North Fame , it has trouble keeping a few minutes comedy skit into a full length comedy . Making something funny is the hardest form of entertainment , and this movie has more hits than misses in its antics . It will always be compared to the Classic Bill and Ted's ; not as good but watchable . ( especially good is the Laverne & Shirley skit )
Strong start	Strong start of the film , but ends like all the other comic movies . I like the beginning of the movie . Who Bruce Wayne is . Why Bruce is scared of Bats ! How Bruce becomes Batman . The theme of when you go out to chase monsters , do not become one yourself is powerful . However , I hate using this metaphor , the ending is the same done it , did it before big climax . The formula has a change to it , but I believe the makers were looking for a different ending but could not just achieve such a ending . The epilogue at the ending leaves room for another film . I like the epilogue discussion of evolution and action and reaction . A thinking man's batman . I would wait for the movie on pay for view . . I did not like Katie Holmes , even with her small row for Batman . I can not reason why .
Sexual humor !	Sexual humor . There is some sexual humor added to cell phone size in this episode . The episode Cell phone has the Constable , and Brent pitted against each other over who has the smaller phone . In the end Lacy tell them they got little Barbie phones . Feeling inferior both the constable and Brent get these huge vintage 1980's cell phones in order to prove they no longer need a small phone . I could never figure out why people want small cell phones . Small phones are too hard to use . I guess lacy is right . A for Cell Phone . I was surprise Hank was not involved in the Cell phone argument . I would go nuts living in Dog River over such crazy conversations . Reminds me of life at the post office .
Surprised at Rourke's performance	I was surprised to see that Mickey Rourke did this movie . He does a lot of B movies . His performance was done very well . He can be a good actor when he applies himself . He just does not know how to pick good roles . The story was interesting . It tells the life of St . Francis of Assissi . It was very inspiritual . It is interesting to see how this sect of monks came to be .
Not bad	Not a bad episode . One notices the close up and dark lighting of the episode which creates a feeling of closeness and tragedy for the show . The lighting gives a feeling of the aftermath of a horrid situation . I believe the J & R subplot , the phone calls to Hawkins , and the show's ending is all building up for the season finale . There is a lot of anger building up in the town of Jericho . I believe all the tension is build up for the climax . I think Jericho may only be 2 seasons . What can the series do for a 3rd year ? Not much . the second best show on TV . Beck is the key character in the series now . How will Beck react to the circumstances ?
Good western	My wife thinks this movie is a dirty portrayal of the West . Historians will argue about Horn and the events that happen in this film , but I like it . Do not watch the edited tv version , to get the real brutal feel of this film rent it . It is a good portrayal of how dirty and nasty the frontier really was . The end suits this film very well , and if my wife can watch an entire Western the film is well done .
Not a bad episode .	Not a bad episode , but the show is running out of ideas . The storyline is about death taking a holiday in small town America . Why is death taking a time out ? Another seal is being broken . I am so tired of the same recurring plot . The producers have to come up with a new storyline . The rest of the story is OK , with a few ideas taken from the movie Ghost . Well directed and acted I found the episode entertaining . However , the ending with another seal being broken was disappointing . The subplot of the personal wedge between Sam and Dean grows . Sam is becoming a new character has his powers grow . I wonder if Dean will have to face Sam about this ? Will Sam turn evil ? I give this show a . Good but not great .
A bridge episode .	Is Sam evil ? The good guys warn of Sam's powers . Sam uses his power but for good . Dean has a mission . Will it involve Sam ? What is everything leading up to . The plot devices of the evil blond , Halloween and Sam's showdown with a very evil guy is in the mix . Not a bad episode but Supernatural's forth season is getting redundant . OK episode . Seven for this show . Love the Impelia the best plot device in the show . They should have a show just on the Impelia . I like the first season best . The second season was OK too . the 3rd season lacked for a while . Did not mind the 4th season so far . Howevery the producers seem to be running out of ideas .
A good made for TV movie !	Robert Urich was a fine actor , and he makes this TV movie believable . I remember watching this film when I was 15 , and when seeing it a second time my opinion stays the same . People lose who they were when enter this exclusive club , in a computer rich Californian town . Urich try's to figure out what is wrong with his family , and I love the Halloween space suit idea , brilliant . This film is about the battle of one's sprit . TV quality , that exceeds , the big budget , Gangs of New York . I wonder if Robert Urich was the compassionate man he portrayed in many of his movie ? I hope so ! 6 or .
Interesting	This film is interesting . A crazed , women killer who use the system for his own benifit . Bronson play a Death Wish type cop who resorts to vigalatism or dirty cop methods to stop this . I found my wife interested in this film , the horror aspect is like a made for TV movie marketed towards women . This is one of Bronson's better films !
Great concept	A fat man , actually a very nasty lawyer type , gets a curse put on him where he loses 7 pounds a day . At first its great , but latter on it becomes a slow burn , or as he puts it " I am being erased " . It is not horror in the conventional way , where a man jumps out of the closet with a butcher knife , it is way more psychological . A slow death , where he has to do anything or he will die . This is a great concept , and the viewer slowly watches the fat man , become anoretic . This move made me want to eat after I watched it , because its one errie feeling watching the transformation . True horror because the victim punishment is so severe .
Better than the first .	There is 2 elements that clash with this film . One the horror gore element , and 2nd the philosophy part . Yes there is a philosophy in this madness . The horror gore element will evolve into the modern Friday the 13th sequals . I can see Final destination 12 years form now with young people dieing in more dramatic fashions with each film . Instead of a Goalie mask , and the woods as the fear stimulus , we got death and fate against us . The first film was wimpy , especially the lead character , the new film picks up speed , and believe me the momentum will pick up with each film . The pilosophy part of the film is about fate or absolutism verses free will and choice . I believe if Death has a design and people out living there fate makes a time ripple against its own ends there would be no way to stop it , and the characters efforts would be useless . The film makers create chaos theory were random event can create an order that has great effects on individuals . The plate of pasta , and the gas turn off would be 2 examples of this . The film has its usual gross outs , and sick humor . In the end , I give it a
Lags behind the first film !	Spoilers ! ! ! What a bad summer for movies , hopefully the fall schedule will improve . The film has a couple of huge flaws . One , the director , I can understand some of the shakey camera work in trying to create anxiety , with fast choppy thinking . Real life events can appear to the mind in this way , with the sensory overload . Trouble with the camera work is too shakey , were the viewers see nothing , and too long where the viewer either gets sick or confused . The style can be executed better . Two , the reason for the attempt on Bourne's life was weak , unless Bourne 3 will reveal a different reason . A huge let down for the climax . The crowd scenes , car chases , and fights with Bourne's wet work rival is the strong part of this movie . The ending saves the lack of story , and weak character in the first half . Why would they kill off all the strong characters from the first movie ? The Donald Rumsfield look alike is believable , and the brush cut , military / republican conservative looking agent gave realism for this series . This is like killing M in the Bond series . I hope Damon will not have this Clariss / Hannabil relationship with the new CIA women . Get a more original idea .
Not bad , but not great	After I watched this movie I did not say " wow this movie blew me away . " This is a good movie , but I have seen it before . I like submarine movies , and Hunt for Red October and Das Boat create a better feel . The Russian accents were horrible and the communist angle could be exploited more . The film is exciting , and I like the drama , but it is still a .
3 . 9 ?	A predictable movie , but 3 . 9 ? The movie is not that bad ! I liked the pace , and direction . Predictable , if one has seen the original . Acted well , and the effects were good . It was Scary in parts . It is worth seeing . I have seen awful movies . This film is not a bad film like Tomb Raider or Weekend at Bernie's . I would rate the film a 7 or . I would give a 3 . 9 for the latter two , but not the Fog . A different kind of story for current horror / suspense movies . The week point for the film is the unfolding of the ending . Wasn't the original set in Maine ? I like the fact that the movies are giving an explanation to why it is happening . This explanation concept was also used in the New Amityville movie .
Sick film	This film is sick , you bet it is . Many people will be repulsed by this work . I myself found this film on the edge of sick to brilliant . It goes through the issue of cannibalism and one eats to live and the morals of surviving on the expense of others . Good criticism of society and we may not eat each other , but we do victimize each other daily . Guy Pearce and Robert Carlyle back up a very strong cast . If you can get over how strange this move is you will find it integrating , or at least I know I did . For history bluffs this movie is influenced by the events of the Donnor party . The movie was marketed for gen x and probably the high school crowd , it is not for every one
I like it	I have biases , towards sci fi and former Winnipeggers . I like Rod Pipper , and he did much better than the Rock on his first film . This is a neat little film about mind control with lots of violences added in . David Keith another b actor plays one of his better roles since The Thing . The fight between Keith and Piper is a classic , with some wrestling too boot . Mindless fun for the TBS crowd .
Surprisingly good !	When I heard Oliver Stone was involved in this picture , and after watching that anxiety filled Natural Born Killers , I decided to pass on this film . Like Nixon I was having one of my insomnia spells , and started watching it late night . Unable to see this film in it's entirety I rented it with my wife . The film was not a hatched job from the left , but if some of what I saw is true it gave me a better understanding of the man . Of course Stone goes overboard like in Any Given Sunday with weird add ins , and this Cuban slash CIA Kennedy theory . I am happy they left out the deleted scene at the end of the video . What I learned was how hard Nixon's life was , and how it molded his character , with his brothers ' deaths , this man never gave up . He was a true outsider unlike JFK , and they , which they the system the left hated him for it . I agree with the part where Richard's mother tells him happiness is in the next life and strength is in this one . I did not become surprised or upset about his behavior , how does one act behind closed doors with confidence . Men with power have to make hard decisions , and people will die , these jobs can not be for the weak . Bush and Clinton signed many death warrants as governor . Like Clinton's downfall with his enemies both presidents believe in positions , leverage politics , and thought they could weasel out . Great casting especially Paul Sorvino , and James Woods .
6 or	A six or . Not a bad movie . The movie is geared for family entertainment . Well directed and acted . Cage is out to protect his family Honor and the honor of his great granddad . A quick pace , with great stunts and sets IE Mount Rushmore . The presidents desk , and the Queens desks were great scenes . I will not ruin anymore , for the movie involves the president , and book . Worth dinner and a movie . . Edd Harris has a good performance . Harris seems to play the roles of a heavy . Watch this movie in the theartier . Rent the movie instead of buying it . On rental night one needs a big screen to watch this film .
A solid 7	This is a good movie , not a great movie . Better to see on the big screen , and it is worth the 8 . 50 I paid for . I am a follower of history , and when I entered the movie line for the film I hoped this would not turn into a either or hollywood or politically correct film , in order to have a believable script . It did , the story was a little hollywood , but gave a good description of the brutality , and views of the time . I will not spoil the story , but it is sort of out a Shakespearian play , with revenge being the main motivator in the story line . This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time , and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy . A good epic . The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic , and the action is done with perfection . It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day , because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film . The film wasn't too long either , and that is good considering how long it was . I gave it a 7 maybe , because it didn't grab me , but if I watch it another time I will probably like it more .
Filmed like a documentary	Friday Night Light's is filmed like a documentary . I personally learned much about American high school football . In Canada , where Canadians only play 3 downs , high school football only has the parents , and some guy walking his dog by the park watching the game . In America , real football culture , with radio shows , ex players wearing their rings , and a crowd of 12000 a game . I believe one player's dad's problem was the dad had nothing else after high school football . The father peaked at 17 ! Billy Bob actually plays a good role . I was surprised the makers added realism , and seriousness of the game showing many hidden aspects like racial politics , violent on field intimidation , and fear of losing . I can not believe the Astro dome was filled for a high school game . Worth seeing on the big screen .
Good film go out and see it .	A good film go out and see Prom Night . I like prom night . I notice from my film and literature course the directors style of using faraway shots then moving towards close up shots creates a feel of the macro to the micro for films films environment . The viewer resonates a bond with the lead protagonist with the macro to micro camera work . A believable story of a sick teachers obsession with a student . Not believable 10 years ago , but just tun on to CNN and there is a deranged teacher story on the news everyday . A few cheesy spots in the film , but all horror films need cheese . The cheesy flat characters create the lotion to lubricate the movie . The jerk and lackey cops always become victims in any horror movies to portray the danger of the killer . scares for Prom Night . A good drive in movie , but they closed the drive in this year . Sob Sob !
Not , not bad at all !	I remember going to drive inn with my parent and sister . I was in grade 5 , and still a kid , and the drive closed down 4 years later , but the film still lingers in my memory . An adult movie , which a kid finds entertaining . That is a mark of excellence . Hoffman is one of hollywoods better actors , and this film proves it . I like the Billy put down the ice cream scene , and I remember the SCTV version in there film I factory myself . Remember Joe Flairty crying . Please email me if you like the SCTV skit . Not a bad film at all , it is a story about a father , and his son . Touching and intertaining , I love the part where Hoffman talks about Killroy , and how the streets change . Worth a second watch .
Not bad	Spoilers My wife is sick over my holidays , and I found a movie I though she would like . Keith has found some work , welcome back . The story is not that bad , and picks up in the second half . Alright acted . I personally found the scenes with the Soviet realistic . Most be a lot of memories for the producers of this film . My wife was glued for the second half of this movie . Not a bad film worth renting . I would give this film a . A romance type film , more geared for my wife . The part with the records is the best . My wife thought the one part where the lead character cuts his leg off is unbelievable . The guy would have bled too death . Communism did not look like a lot fun watching this film .
Same old Same old	This film is the same old same old , with some funny scenes . Thisfilm will not age well , and become forgotten like most of this partytype films . Will Ferial , stands out in this fim , and make it betterthan most colledge movies . A movie rental . I give it a
Nerds ! ! ! ! Nerds ! ! ! ! Nerds ! ! ! !	I love this movie ; it is a true classic . It is dated , and one has to understand the 80's macho , old beer commercial perfect , women magnet type of guy attitude of the time . Forget the Boy bands of today , the macho jocks would have chased these wimps out of the school dance ! Unless you had some slick political skills or played a mean axe ( guitar for those not from the 80's ) the top of the food chain ruled . Talk about computers , bad dress , or social slowness labelled you a nerd . Now the computer geeks rule in 00's ; there is true revenge . The movie like animal house looks very dated . Animal house has been copied too death to the point that the shock value is gone , and so is the humor . The heros of animal house are viewed as the jerks of today for whoever had their childish pranks pulled on them . Animal house led the evolution for revenge of the Nerds , where the pranksters became the norm and picked on the nerds . The dated part is where the social out casts get sympathy , where now a days people worry that the weird nerd could go nuts . They have a Walton's joke that no one would get know , and a couple of the nerds would fit in today's grung or PC crowd . The part that keeps this film on top is the writing . What the nerds lack in social skills , looks , and muscles they make up in brains . They get their revenge on the Jocks , with some dated non PC tactics that make me laugh . In the end , I love the part where they yell Nerds ! ! ! Nerds ! ! and one of them say , " who are they talking too ? " .
Like it like it like it	Saw this on HBO with my parents one vacation . I like this movie , it has a story which includes suspenses , horror , mystery and action . Not too many movies have this combination . Great acting by Shaw , his role is on par with Jaws . The under water filming is the best of any under water film . Then tension and fear with the under water scenes leave an impression on one's mind . A classic shown on TBS late night , I will tape the next time I see it on . They usually show the movie The Island afterwards , I never seen that one ; I wonder if it is any good being the second feature . Rent it , tape it , or buy it ! You will not be disappointed .
I like this one !	I , or my wife bought , the box set . I did not see all the episodes of the first season , and wanted to catch up on the back ground of the show . I liked ' Wendigo ' and found the second show much like the first ' Pilot ' . The first two episodes the actors were creating a feel or chemistry between the two brothers ; by the fourth show the two lead character's created the full chemistry for the series . Wendigo episode portrays Dean as smart a , and Sam as independent thinker . The best part of the show is the banter between Dean and the hunting guide . The Wendigo creature and the tunnels provide the catalyst for a creepy background . Movie quality supporting actors , sets , writing , and directing gives the viewer a movie quality TV show . I Love the music and Wendigo is fun to watch . .
Stallone's come back movie !	This is a good film , after the last couple of stinkers Stallone has done , this film puts him back into the grove . Well written , where the characters go beyond 2 dimensional . The people in the film have faults , good points , and bad points ; in the end they can surprise you . This film has great action scenes , tension , conflict , and a great German race car driver that my wife thinks portrays my own personality . In the end I was entertained , thanks Sly , and keep the good work up , if you read this . Mike
One of the strong show's on TV	I find the characters a little too type-casted and a little to stereotyped . Those negative aspects of the show are far outweighed by the positive . House is a brilliant character , who's brilliance makes House a loner for he is 2 steps ahead of everyone else , and is annoyed by others . Do other doctors fight and have personality conflicts with each other in such tense situations while having to rely on each other . The producers could be creating more drama than reality . The story stimulates the reader with interesting plot twists and medical problems . My wife wishes her doctor was just as thorough as House . He is a gem even though he is rough . He expects the best from his staff .
Classic	This is the best of the Vacation movie series , and one of the few successful films Chev Chase has done . It is a what can go wrong does go wrong vacation ; the movie addresses vacation form hell scenarios of : relatives , in-laws , car problems , money problems , family trouble , with some sex appeal , and action added in to make the story spicy . Its a good movie and I gave it a .
Love that squirrel	This was a great animation with lots of humor . Denis Leary's voice is always recognizable . This film is great for kids but also entertaining for adults . The voices suited the characters . This is one that I will purchase when it comes out . I felt sorry for the doodoo birds . A good family orientated film .
What a turn to make !	This would be anyone's worst nightmare while on the road . If someone does not no an end of town of country , they do not know what to look out for . This movie is believable as there are some pretty sick people out there . The story kept one guessing . The momentum built throughout . The lead actor played in the Messenger : Joan of Ark Story . He is not a bad actor . It was worth seeing . It was scary without being too gory .
I really enjoyed this film .	Sometimes , I watch a movie , and because of my mood I thought it was great , and I see it 2 years later with doubts that it is the same movie . I hope this is not the case ! The acting is top notch , and the surroundings perfect . I understand the story , with the urban decay message . Winnipeg has many areas similar with this story . This movie has a social message , and thankfully not a heavy one , where decay is not just the neighborhood , but with the people . Broken marriages , broken families , and broken lives create broken neighborhoods . What we say , do , and choices have consequences . People dumping there responsibilites , acting 19 as an adult , not working on their marriages or families is a social diease of our time . The director conveys this excellently . De Niro left his family , and the consequence of it , and later in this movie he owes up for this , and his son trys to do the same . When the family lets you down , and we all need help , it's difficult to recover . Funny , my uncle thought from a generation earlier divorce was good for the kids , because there were so few then , and now the kids have a different opinion . Movie for our time .
Great horror movie with a social message .	Spoilers . I love an intelligent horror movie with a real life social message . These two premises usually work out great . This film has a new twist . This kid whose love for the dark side and gore receives a new neurological computer game that interacts with his mind , via Videodrome . This film shows the social aspects of violence , and the murder is very graphic , and sickening on purpose ; where the victim suffers . This guy has to deal with the consequences of his actions and guilt . ( A nice kid who has to live with this , now that is the scary part ) An evil being called the Trickster torments him , and his other victims have faces , personalities , and people he knows . The people behave believably . This is where the message comes in at the ending when he finds out that what went on is a game , he is sicken and angry . He positively drops the negativity of his fascination of horror and grows up and gets on with life . He stops being a weirdo and starts interacting with other teens .
Hidden gem	I have been renting older films because of the lack of any good new releases . This film pits man and machine against the elements . All the characters have a bad past and need money to leave the bad environment they live in . The bridge scene is tense and the music is great . The name for this film does not belong .
A happy family movie	Spoiler ! A surprise ending about hope . I watched this movie with my wife and nephew Austin . Austin enjoyed the movie . Austin liked how people can change . My wife liked the dog . Myself found it a little long at the beginning , but as the movie progressed the pace and flow melded into a entertaining movie . The guy from Law and Order played a good part . It was different seeing him in such a different role . The movie gives you a feeling of country life . They even had the nasty neighbour . The other dogs in the movie were mean because they were mistreated , but with a little love and kindest , they can change . Overall it is a good movie for the family to watch .
Another good movie with a 70's feel	Another good movie with a 70's feel . If any of the IMDb readers reading my critique watch late night movies , like myself , they will notice a 7ups or Marathon man gritty 70's style to ' We own the night ' . A strong drama about family , tradition , crime , and the interaction of individuals in society . Great script , excellently executed by the powerful cast of Phoenix , Wahlberg , and Duvell . The near ending part with smoking the bad guy out is powerful . The full circle of who we are is brought out with Phoenix's character development . The real Phoenix is a cop , not the Phoenix of the club whose friends are the ones who betray him . There are the themes of honesty over deception and compassion over selfishness ! The prodigal son has returned . . Run don't walk to see ' We own the night .
Many plot ploys	The Dean and Jo sexual tension plot ploy is implemented on the many stories and sub stories which intertwine in the complex series Super Natural . Did Jo go on the hunt because of Dean ? Did she go for she wants to be a hunter ? Maybe both or even because of family fighting ? Jo acts annoyed and makes it deliberately obvious that she is ignoring Dean . The story heightens with Jo needing to be rescued by Sam and Dean . Did Sam and Dean screw up ? They find out later that John Winchester ( their dad ) mistakenly killed Jo's father . The cold as ice song hits the mark for humor when Sam and Dean drive Jo and her ( over protective ) mother home . . Will Dean and Jo meet up again ? I guess we will find out in season three .
Strong film	This story is very 80's , and is heavily influenced by the TV show Miami Vice . The style , clothes , music , and characters reflect that time period exactly . The direction of this film gives a slick feel ; where its action , style , and seedy underside all blend in well . The story could be very predictable , but with its plots twists , and the theme that follows the saying be careful when you go hunting for monster not to become one yourself gives it originality . It has some mind blowing stunts that create tension , and if you watch the film Ronin you see where they got the car chase idea from . In all this film gives a feeling of being involved in events that go too fast , too dangerous , and too twisted . Its shows what happens to the heart when the individual becomes obsessed with what he seeks . Watch this one and love it .
Great movie	" Any where but here ? " Is a line Kurt Russel says in this film . It is such a good film . I can watch it 20 times and never tier of it . You will stay glued to the set with this story , and when the people monster out you will jump out of your seat . Russel character is a role model for myself . He is not a wimpy , politically correct 90's guy ; who's into his own feelings , but a sarcastic , realist who is a hard drinking and toughf . Somone you would need in a situation like this . The suporting cast is just a good . Your typical group of guys with faults and different personalities , that would act stressed out in these situations . The plot makes alot of sence and is truly scary . Nice to see a believable film with real type people in it . Not your typical perfect hollywood types who a 2 dimentional story .
This movie gave my wife the creeps	This movie builds its fear on tension . This style is better than what the majority of horror films do , where gore and shock is the catalyst for fear . They say anticipation of death is worse than death itself , which is what this film is all about . When they stumble upon Jeeper Creeper , we do not know if it is a man or beast . It methodically stalks its victims , and when night falls , the fear worsen . The conclusion ties up all loose ends , along with a shocking memorable ending .
This is a good film	My wife loves this film , and I found it more then a romance movie . A intriguing story , of deception , death , the after life , and greed . This is a great film , with character you care about , suspense , romance , and a fresh script . This film made Patricks carrier , and after this film he chose a few films that killed his chances of acting in higher budget films . I believe if he picked a couple more scripts like this one he would be on the same level as Tom Cruse . I think the politically correct 90's found him too macho for their tastes , and it drove him to do that film about India which helped kill his carrier . In the end this film is a little about what Patrick could have been , a true international star .
Entertaining comedy	Spoiler ! I didn't know what to expect from this film . It was great . Matthew should do more comedies . They had a card game in this film which based itself on being able to read people . Sometimes people portray what they are really not . It takes a talented person to be able to see through all that hoopla . Many of the things the woman did in the film were annoying and psychotic . They were using each other and in the end it worked against them for the one thing that was unexpected .
If you love the bar you'll love this film .	This film is great , the director set a pace in this film , which reflects the bar perfectly . People complain about this because Tom Cruse is too self centered , sexually lose , or poney , and I differ on these issues . The bar scene has all these attributes and Cruse plays the bar wolf perfectly . Of course there is a Romance and he learns about growing up . In the end I find this film truthful and honest .
The last good Jame Bond Movie	This was the last of the James Bond movie too have that Bond magic to it . One of Moores better Bond movies along with Man with the Golden gun , and For your eyes only . This film keeps the humor and non seriousness which makes the Bond films enjoyable . Excellent stunts , funny moments , and a interesting plot , gives this film the Bond magic , which was missing with Tim Dalton . I love the scene when a tour group asks Bond what travel tour he is with , and he say economey . I hope the new Bond can create some of this magic .
One excellent picture .	The Australian film board has done excellent work , compared to Canada we should be ashamed . Except for arty films , or ultra left wing films , which sometimes insult the public they never have come close to making a watchable film . Who ever did the casting for Breaker Morant , did an excellent job . Woodward , Brown , etc and the actor who plays Clark where standouts in a cast without one weak actor . The script and filming looks , and sounds turn of the century . ( well researched ) Did they deserve to be shot , I do not know . In my opinion , ( I know that sounds wordy ) this film hit true too life . Comparable with today's Political Correctness many decisions become political instead of truthful . How many job interviews , hearings , University acceptances , fights between people will be decided before the interview , trial , application , or discussion has began . I believe the truth is always unpopular but eventually appears . This film is an excellent portrayal of the human condition .
One of the better episodes	This series has many clever hooks for the audience . Such hooks are the tribute to the ' Exorcist ' with Blair , and a cute mention about her at the end of the show . I find supernatural does all sorts of tributes to horror movie . Red rum is mentioned with the Dana Schults deal , a tribute to the Shinning . The episode shows how smart the Winchester boy are with the police . Perfect how one brother helps the other . Sam this time plays the lead . Dean add the comic relief . A good mystery . I like how the bad cop is annoyed with Dean . I don't want to say more or I will ruin the show . The story has one mystery Dana Schults which really leads to another . . One of the better ones for season two . Glad I bought the second season .
Sam get's attacked by a cougar	. A great story well acted and directed . Sam and Dean battle a cursed object . Humor rules this episode with the following plot devices : Dean takes hits at the expense of his Impala . Bella becomes Sam and Dean's problem . The Bella , Dean rivalry begins , and the sexual tension starts . Sam has sexual tension of his own and takes a hit for the mission , while Dean calls Sam a cougar hound . ( the best comic part of the show ) Sam reminds the women of her late husband . The show has the usual twist , and different endings . Bella will most definitely return for a later show . I like this show . On a more serious note Sam and Dean are starting to fight with Dean's character flaw of not caring about him self hero mode at the expense of others .
The best movie so far this year .	Spoilers So far , this year is a bad year for movies . Until The Passion of the Christ came out this year is the most forgettable for movies . This movie is a 10 because it is made so well . Directing , acting , lighting etc . If the viewer never understood Roman corporal and capital punishment they will after seeing this film . I pray the Rosary , and Tuesdays and Fridays meditations is on the crucifixion , and I believe this is where Gibson bases this film on . The viewer better understands the sacrifice Jesus made for man , and the trials and events that unfold during Good Friday . This film is directed exceptionally well , if one did not read the sub-titles they could still follow the story because of the pace and direction of Gibson's film . Is it realistic ? Yes very much like the meditations themselves . Should everyone see it ? No not young kids . Will it win any awards ? It should win best picture but leftwing Hollywood would never politically do this . The realism of Gibsons interpretations is helped with great details . The guard whos heart changes , after Jesus heals him . The brutal guards enjoy their work , one can understand why these guards where chosen for this job . They do it so well they get into trouble for over doing it . Judas anxiety is believable . These minor details give this film creditability . The location is excellent ; I wish too visit this town one day . Pilots handling the situation is shown extremely well , Pilot has the best performance of the show . I know that I understand the crucifiction better after viewing this film .
