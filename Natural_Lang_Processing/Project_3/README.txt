Using the program (T1-T2):
Open the terminal
Navigate to the location where the “FILE_NAME.tar.gz” file was downloaded
Ex. if downloaded to Downloads, enter “cd Downloads”
To extract the “FILE_NAME.tar.gz” file, type "tar -zxvf FILE_NAME.tar.gz"
Type “FILE_NAME” to enter the extracted folder named FOLDER_NAME containing the Python code
Type “FILE_NAME.py path1 path2 path3”, and hit enter. Path1 is the path to the imdb62.txt file, path2 is the path to where the train directory will be created, and path3 is the path to where the test directory will be created
The program will then output to those directories

Example: $ yourProgramName /path/to/imdb62.txt /path/to/train /path/to/testNote: The $ sign is just a symbol to represent a linux-style command-line prompt.  The user wouldn’t actually type the $ sign.
